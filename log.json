The aim of the present descriptive and observational study was to analyze injury severity depending on the seating position during HEMS accidents in Germany. \nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from the German Federal Agency for Flight Accident Investigation was gathered for a period of 40 years (from 1970 to 2009). The seating position in the aircraft during the accident and the resulting injury severity (i.e., 1=no; 2=slight; 3=severe; and 4=fatal) were recorded. Injury severity was compared using the Fisher's exact test. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. \nRESULTS: A total of n=99 accidents were investigated (n=61 accidents did not lead to any injuries in the occupants, n=7 accidents resulted in minor, and n=6 in severe injuries, and lethal injuries resulted from n=15 accidents). The occupant in the \"patient\" position was most likely to suffer from deadly injuries (44.9%), followed by the HEMS crew member rear seat (25.0%), compared to lower lethality rates in the other seating positions (9.4-11.2%). Sitting on the HEMS crew member rear seat also was associated with the highest percentage of severe and minor injuries (12.5% each). \nCONCLUSIONS: In HEMS accidents, the patients' position and the HEMS crew member rear seat were found to be at the highest risk for fatal or severe injuries. These results support the urgent requirement of a large international data base for HEMS accidents as a basis for further studies to improve the safety in HEMS missions. \nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The questionnaire included questions about the incidence of bicycle-related accidents and subsequent injury within a year, the degree of injury and presence or absence of reporting that injury (bicycle-related accident) to the police. For the bicycle-related accident, we asked regarding both riding and pedestrian accidents (i.e., accidents caused by a bicycle when walking). \nRESULTS: Excluding the blank responses (n=3539, 50.0%), the targets for analysis were 3098 older adults in riding accidents and 2861 older adults in pedestrian accidents. The results showed that 63.0% of older adults (n=1953) routinely rode a bicycle. Among them, 9.4% (n=184) experienced riding accidents, and 3.4% (n=98) experienced pedestrian accidents caused by a bicycle. For the riding accidents, 76.1% (n=140) had some injuries, and for the pedestrian accidents, 55.1% (n=54) had some injuries. Furthermore, in 70.2% (n=59) and 76.9% (n=20) of riding and pedestrian accidents, respectively, those who went to the hospital for treatment of their injury (i.e., injury requiring treatment) did not report the accident to the police. \nCONCLUSION: The present study revealed that there are many potential bicycle-related accidents in older adults.

They require a skillful adaptation and may be the cause of stress. Stress of considerable intensity can receive the joy of life and even lead to a temporary mental disorder. \nTHE AIM OF THE STUDY: To present the main causes and frequency of disturbance determined according to the ICD-10 as a reaction to severe stress and adaptive disorders among patients in psychiatric and psychological counseling and to establish whether the causes of the disorder are dependent on factors such as age, sex or level of education. \nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis was done on a separate group of 754 persons from among patients seeking psychiatric counseling--Psychological Outpatient Mental Health in the 10th Military Clinical Hospital in Bydgoszcz, in 2005. This group were qualified person, who according to the criteria of ICD-10 were found to respond to severe stress and abnormal adaptation. In addition, during the interview determines whether they are long-term somatic illness. They have not been included in the study group. Also excluded persons who were found difficulties in operation prior to the stressful situation and those that have already been treated with psychiatric or psychological benefit from therapy. The collected data were statistically analyzed. \nRESULTS: The analysis identifies three main causes of adjustment disorder. The first group of reasons is related to difficulties in the workplace, which represents 59% of all patients with the disorder described. In this group identifies three major stressful situations: bullying, job loss, unemployment. Another reason relates to family problems. They are the reason for the emergence of abnormalities in 23% of patients analyzed group. Among these difficulties was divided into four main types of situation causing disorder presented. There are family conflicts, death of spouse, parent death, divorce. The last group of factors are stressful events or incidents which contributed to the disorder in 16% of patients in the group described. In this category were observed four major groups analyzed the causes of the disorder. This is due to the difficulty of adapting to the compulsory military service, traffic accidents, participation in missions abroad, the situation of rape. Making a detailed analysis by category of difficulty is shown that in this group of subjects, age, educational level and gender are significant factors in influencing the formation of these disorders. \nCONCLUSION: The main causes of this disorder are closely related to everyday human activity and especially on employment. Harassment and bad relationships in the workplace, job loss, unemployment are the factors most often causing disorder in question. The analysis made also clear that the situations of family conflict is also a frequent cause of severe reactions to stress and adjustment disorder.

The analysis of accident victim characteristics showed that all age groups are at risk, and that most victims were young adult men vehicle drivers with experience and wearing helmets. Spinal injury levels were cervical, three; thoracic, three; and thoracolumbar, six. Categorized accident hazard patterns were loss of control, six; tipover, four; and hidden obstacle, two. Contributing causative factors to the accident occurrence were poor driver judgment, seven, and vehicle instability, eight. Speeding was the most frequent primary cause of ORV accidents. We discuss vehicle and driver performance characteristics as they relate to risk of accident occurrence.

All except 1 eye (9 of 10) were diagnosed with total or near-total ocular surface failure. Limbal stem cell transplantation was performed in 8 of 10 eyes. Keratolimbal allograft was followed by penetrating keratoplasty in 7 of 10 eyes. Ocular surface stability was achieved in 7 of 10 eyes after keratolimabl allograft. Postoperative visual acuity was better than 20/200 in 4 of 10 of eyes.

This paper investigates the incidence of PTSD after traffic accidents in Germany. Data from an accident research unit were analyzed in regard to collision details, and preclinical and clinical data. Preclinical data included details on crash circumstances and estimated injury severity as well as data on victims' conditions (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, consciousness, breath rate). Clinical data included initial assessment in the emergency department, radiographic diagnoses, and basic life parameters comparable to the preclinical data as well as follow-up data on the daily ward. Data were collected in the German-In-Depth Accident Research study, and included gender, type of accident (e.g. type of vehicle, road conditions, rural or urban area), mental disorder, and AIS (Abbreviated Injury Scale) head score. AIS represent a scoring system to measure the injury severity of traffic accident victims. A total 258 out of 32807 data sets were included in this analysis. Data on accident and victims was collected on scene by specialized teams following established algorithms. Besides higher AIS Head scores for male motorcyclists compared to all other subgroups, no significant correlation was found between the mean maximum AIS score and the occurrence of PTSD. Furthermore, there was no correlation between higher AIS head scores, gender, or involvement in road traffic accidents and PTSD. In our study the overall incidence of PTSD after road traffic accidents was very low (0.78% in a total of 32.807 collected data sets) when compared to other published studies. The reason for this very low incidence of PTSD in our patient sample could be seen in an underestimation of the psychophysiological impact of traffic accidents on patients. Patients suffering from direct experiences of traumatic events such as a traffic accident and presenting with signs of clinically significant distress or impairment in social interactions should be treated in a team approach including not only trauma surgeons and surgical skilled staff but also psychophysiological experienced physicians."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[0, 2, \"C0038436;T048;47505003\", \"Posttraumatic stress disorder\"], [8, 8, \"C0011900;T060;439401001\", \"diagnosis\"], [11, 11, \"C0683278;T048;706873003\", \"suffering\"], [18, 18, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [19, 19, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries.\"], [59, 59, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [69, 69, \"C0018787;T023;80891009.C1281570;T023;302509004\", \"heart\"], [71, 72, \"C1272641;T033;386536003,364090009,386534000\", \"blood pressure,\"], [74, 74, \"C0225386;T031;11891009\", \"breath\"], [80, 80, \"C1261322;T058;129265001,386053000\", \"assessment\"], [123, 123, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle,\"], [130, 131, \"C0004936;T048;74732009\", \"mental disorder,\"], [135, 135, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"Injury\"], [137, 137, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [147, 147, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [184, 184, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"Head\"], [218, 218, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [242, 243, \"C0442811;T033;260362008\", \"very low\"], [263, 264, \"C0442811;T033;260362008\", \"very low\"], [288, 288, \"C0683278;T048;706873003\", \"suffering\"], [307, 307, \"C0231303;T033;69328002\", \"distress\"], [309, 309, \"C0684336;T046;40226000\", \"impairment\"], [323, 323, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"trauma\"], [326, 326, \"C0543467;T061;387713003,257556004,83578000\", \"surgical\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[2, 4, \"C0038436;T048;47505003\", \"posttraumatic stress disorder\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["69328002", "129265001", "96005000", "386536003", "74732009", "364090009", "417163006", "47505003", "439401001", "69536005", "387713003", "386534000", "260362008", "40226000", "80891009", "417746004", "302548004", "24484000", "257556004", "706873003", "412307009", "386053000", "302509004", "83578000", "11891009"], "id": "ce431578-41c0-4312-8285-fdfe737539b0", "_version_": 1673674839092625412}, {"title": ["[Traffic accidents associated with emotional stress after divorce]."], "journal": "Fa Yi Xue Za Zhi", "journal_id": "9426151", "date": "2009-06-20T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "19537257", "abstract": ["In recent years, the traffic accidents increased gradually, especially those caused by the drivers daily emotional abnormality and in which the drivers were liable.

Many of these victims are pedestrians. The present retrospective study analyzes the severity and mortality of injuries suffered by adult pedestrians, depending on whether they used a zebra crosswalk. \nMETHODS: Our retrospective data analysis covered adult patients admitted to our emergency department (ED) between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2012 after being hit by a vehicle while crossing the road as a pedestrian. Patients were identified by using a string term. Medical, police and ambulance records were reviewed for data extraction. \nRESULTS: A total of 347 patients were eligible for study inclusion. Two hundred and three (203; 58.5%) patients were on a zebra crosswalk and 144 (41.5%) were not. The mean ISS (injury Severity Score) was 12.1 (SD 14.7, range 1-75). The vehicles were faster in non-zebra crosswalk accidents (47.7 km/n, versus 41.4 km/h, p<0.027). The mean ISS score was higher in patients with non-zebra crosswalk accidents; 14.4 (SD 16.5, range 1-75) versus 10.5 (SD13.14, range 1-75) (p<0.019). Zebra crosswalk accidents were associated with less risk of severe injury (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.98, p<0.042). Accidents involving a truck were associated with increased risk of severe injury (OR 3.53, 95%CI 1.21-10.26, p<0.02). \nCONCLUSION: Accidents on zebra crosswalks are more common than those not on zebra crosswalks. The injury severity of non-zebra crosswalk accidents is significantly higher than in patients with zebra crosswalk accidents. Accidents involving large vehicles are associated with increased risk of severe injury. Further prospective studies are needed, with detailed assessment of motor vehicle types and speed."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[12, 12, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [37, 37, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [77, 77, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"], [102, 102, \"C0185115;T061;62972009,129415008\", \"extraction.\"], [134, 134, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"(injury\"], [189, 189, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [190, 190, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [207, 207, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [208, 208, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [229, 229, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [255, 255, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [256, 256, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury.\"], [264, 264, \"C1261322;T058;129265001,386053000\", \"assessment\"], [267, 267, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"Injury\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["129265001", "129415008", "417746004", "96005000", "412307009", "62972009", "417163006", "386053000", "24484000"], "id": "8238bd9e-06e7-4ee2-8c9a-e47e6cdc9859", "_version_": 1673674715192885259}, {"title": ["Differences in rural and urban driver-injury severities in accidents involving large-trucks: an exploratory analysis."], "journal": "Accid Anal Prev", "journal_id": "1254476", "date": "2005-06-07T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "15935320", "abstract": ["This study explores the differences between urban and rural driver injuries (both passenger-vehicle and large-truck driver injuries) in accidents that involve large trucks (in excess of 10,000 pounds). Using 4 years of California accident data, and considering four driver-injury severity categories (no injury, complaint of pain, visible injury, and severe/fatal injury), a multinomial logit analysis of the data was conducted. Significant differences with respect to various risk factors including driver, vehicle, environmental, road geometry and traffic characteristics were found to exist between urban and rural models. For example, in rural accidents involving tractor-trailer combinations, the probability of drivers' injuries being severe/fatal increased about 26% relative to accidents involving single-unit trucks. In urban areas, this same probability increased nearly 700%. In accidents where alcohol or drug use was identified as being the primary cause of the accident, the probability of severe/fatal injury increased roughly 250% percent in rural areas and nearly 800% in urban areas. While many of the same variables were found to be significant in both rural and urban models (although often with quite different impact), there were 13 variables that significantly influenced driver-injury severity in rural but not urban areas, and 17 variables that significantly influenced driver-injury severity in urban but not rural areas.

The aim of this paper is to survey the injury mechanism of intracerebral hemorrhage in vehicle accidents, including contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), subdural hematoma (SDH) and diffuse axonal injury (DAI). \nMETHODS: A condensed overview is given based on the published studies in biomechanical studies on intracerebral hemorrhage. Animal tests, cadaver tests, accident investigations and numerical simulation are the main method used for the mechanism studies. \nRESULTS: Angular velocity and acceleration can be used to predict these injuries and they are the main causation of DAI. Intracranial pressure is the main causation of coup/contrecoup contusion. Shear stress and strain contribute to the rupture of bridging veins that result in SDH, SAH. \nCONCLUSION: Injury mechanism of intracerebral hemorrhage in vehicle accidents is complicated that with multiple causations.

However, there was evidence of an increased risk of more severe accidents in the population with epilepsy. The risk was increased by about 40% for serious injuries and there was evidence of a twofold risk of increase in non-driver fatalities. These increases seem largely explicable by the occurrence of seizures in this population during the three years of driving that the survey covered. \nCONCLUSIONS: The acceptability of driving for people with a history of epilepsy should be determined by an acceptable risk of accidents resulting in injury or serious injury rather than overall accident rates.

All patients had severe limbal stem cell deficiency with total ocular surface failure. Eight eyes received a conjunctival-limbal autograft (CLAU) with a keratolimbal allograft (KLAL), 1 eye received a living related-conjunctival limbal allograft (lr-CLAL) with a KLAL, and 2 eyes received a CLAU with lr-CLAL. Nine eyes underwent subsequent penetrating keratoplasty, and 7 eyes had reconstructive eyelid surgery. Nine eyes demonstrated improved visual acuity at last follow-up; seven eyes demonstrated a stable ocular surface at last follow-up. Nonadherence was noted in 7 patients, either with poor adherence with post-operative treatment or poor follow-up; this portended a worse visual result. \nCONCLUSIONS: Roman candle-related accidents can lead to severe ocular surface injury. Despite total ocular surface failure, these eyes can achieve good postoperative visual results following limbal stem cell transplantation and subsequent keratoplasty with appropriate compliance. \nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Data came from a longitudinal cohort of all Danes who received a diagnosis of reaction to severe stress or adjustment disorders (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code F43.x) between 1995 and 2011, and they were compared with data from a general-population cohort. Cumulative incidence curves were plotted to examine traumatic experiences and psychiatric diagnoses during the study period. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine the associations of the disorders with mortality and suicide. Participants with stress diagnoses had a higher incidence of traumatic events and psychiatric diagnoses than did the comparison group. Each disorder was associated with a higher rate of all-cause mortality than that seen in the comparison cohort, and strong associations with suicide were found after adjustment. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the associations of stress disorders with a variety of outcomes, and we found that stress diagnoses may have long-lasting and potentially severe consequences.  \nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 2015.

Since drivers involved in this study had introductory phase before measuring their reaction times, they faced with unpleasant sound when they made mistake, which forced them to be aware not to make a mistake in further tasks, so they showed longer reaction times. \nCONCLUSION: Measuring of reaction time seems to be important, and as we have showed they are different in drivers who have caused road traffic accidents and those who have do not."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[10, 10, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [75, 75, \"C0001975;T109,T121;333164008,53041004\", \"alcohol\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[]", "snomed_codes": ["417746004", "53041004", "333164008"], "id": "626ea151-d911-4204-9a45-82b09d09337d", "_version_": 1673674251271405589}, {"title": ["Acute stress reactions after submarine accidents."], "journal": "Mil Med", "journal_id": "2984771R", "date": "2002-06-11T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "12053854", "abstract": ["The aim of the present study was to explore contextual and individual factors associated with acute stress reactions in three Norwegian submarine crews exposed to different significant peacetime maneuver accidents.

The work covers technical aspects of severe accidents and thus primarily reflects an engineering perspective on the energy-related risk issues, though some social implications are also touched upon. The assessment concerns fossil energy sources (coal, oil and gas), nuclear power and hydro power. The scope is not limited to the power production (conversion) step of these energy chains but, whenever applicable, also includes exploration, extraction, transports, processing, storage and waste disposal. With the exception of the nuclear chain the focus of the work has been on the evaluation of the historical experience of accidents. The basis used for this evaluation is a comprehensive database ENSAD (Energy-related Severe Accident Database), established by the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). For hypothetical nuclear accidents the probabilistic technique has also been employed and extended to cover the assessment of economic consequences of such accidents. The broader picture obtained by coverage of full energy chains leads on the world-wide basis to aggregated immediate fatality rates being much higher for the fossil chains than what one would expect if only power plants were considered. Generally, the immediate fatality rates are for all considered energy carriers significantly higher for the non-OECD countries than for OECD countries. In the case of hydro and nuclear the difference is in fact dramatic. The presentation of results is not limited to the aggregated values specific for each energy chain.

Therefore, the present study was aimed at assessing the psychological consequences of accidents occurring in several occupational settings (e.g., construction and industry). Thirty-eight victims of occupational accidents (injured workers) and 38 gender-, age-, and years of education-matched workers who never experienced a work accident (control group) were recruited. All participants underwent a semi-structured interview administered by a trained psychologist, and then were requested to fill in the questionnaires. Injured workers reported more severe anxious, post-traumatic and depressive symptoms, and poorer coping skills, as compared to controls. In the injured group low levels of resilience predicted post-traumatic symptomatology, whereas the degree of physical injury and the length of time since the accident did not play a predictive role.

The total poisoning rate was 54.8%, and the total mortality was 16.5%. The average poisoning age was (31.9 +/- 9.8) years old and the average death age was (33.7 +/- 10.3) years old. The poisoning accidents occurred more in men than in women. (2) There were more than 112 chemicals which caused these poisoning accidents. Most of the accidents caused by hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, benzene and homologs, metal and metalloid and carbon dioxide, and the types of chemicals varied in different types of industries. (3) The accidents mainly occurred in chemical industry, manufacture, water disposal industry, mining and construction industry, and the risk was higher in some jobs than others, such as cleanout, machine maintenance and repair, production, mine and digging. The accidents occurred more frequently from April to August each year. \nCONCLUSION: (1) The control over the severe acute occupational poisoning is urgent.

Whereas characterization of injury patterns following motor vehicle accidents has led to safety initiatives and treatment guidelines, knowledge related to bicyclist injuries is lacking. Our purpose is to identify major injury patterns and outcomes associated with pediatric bicycle accidents. \nMETHODS: From January 2000 to December 2012, 1934 consecutive pediatric admissions (\u226417 years) at a level I trauma center were retrospectively reviewed for mechanism injury, demographics, and outcomes. Parametric data were analyzed with student's t test and are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Nonparametric data were analyzed with Mann-Whitney-U test and are presented as median (interquartile range). Analysis was performed to recognize injury patterns and outcomes significantly associated with bicycle related accidents. \nRESULTS: 80 pediatric patients were admitted following bicycle related trauma (4% of all pediatric trauma admissions). The cohort was age 11 \u00b1 4 years, ISS 11 \u00b1 10, 48% black, and 81% male. Injury patterns included 21% isolated head, 21% isolated abdominal, 13% isolated extremity, and 34% multiple injuries. 5% were age 0-4 years, 35% were age 5-9 years, 45% were 10-14 years, and 15% were 15-17 years (p < 0.001). 16% required operative intervention (6% abdominal, 9% orthopedic, 1% vascular). Children under age 6 required an abdominal operation 20% of the time. Length of stay was 2 (4) days with a mortality of 2.5%. \nCONCLUSIONS: Pediatric bicycle accidents more commonly occur in male children aged 10-14 years.

One important measure of accident severity is the most severely injured occupant in the vehicle. Such data are routinely collected in state accident data files in the U.S. Among the many risk factors that determine the most severe level of injury sustained by vehicle occupants, the number of occupants in the vehicle is an important factor. These effects can be significant because vehicles with higher occupancies have an increased likelihood of having someone seriously injured. This paper studies the occupancy/injury severity relationship using Washington State accident data. The effects of large trucks, which are shown to have a significant impact on the most severely injured vehicle occupant, are accounted for by separately estimating nested logit models for truck-involved accidents and for non-truck-involved accidents.

Review of these accidents revealed that unrecognized hypoventilation was the most common cause (seven cases). These seven accidents and one other due to discontinuation of inspired oxygen in all likelihood would have been prevented by appropriate response to earlier warnings generated by the \"safety monitoring\" principles mandated by the Harvard minimal monitoring standards. Analysis suggests capnography (although not mandated) would be the best monitor of ventilation. An important associated issue was the apparent inadequacy of supervision of residents and C.R.N.A.s. The eight preventable accidents represent 88% of the projected insurance payout. Only one accident occurred after the 1985 adoption of the standards (in the month following their implementation).

Furthermore, riding accidents are frequently associated with a high degree of severity of injuries and mortality. Nevertheless, there are insufficient data regarding incidences, demographics, mechanisms of accidents, injury severity and patterns and outcome of injured persons in amateur equestrian sports. Accordingly, it was the aim of the present study to retrospectively analyze these aspects. \nMETHODS: A total of 503 patients were treated in the emergency room of the Hannover Medical School because of an accident during recreational horse riding between 2006 and 2011. The female gender was predominantly affected with 89.5\u2009%. The mean age of the patients was 26.2\u2009\u00b1\u200914.9 years and women (24.5\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5 years) were on average younger than men (40.2\u2009\u00b1\u200923.9 years). A special risk group was girls and young women aged between 10 and 39 years. The overall injury severity was measured using the injury severity score (ISS). \nRESULTS: Based on the total population, head injuries were the most common location of injuries with 17.3\u2009% followed by injuries to the upper extremities with 15.2\u2009% and the thoracic and lumbar spine with 10.9\u2009%. The three most common injury locations after falling from a horse were the head (17.5\u2009%), the upper extremities (17.4\u2009%), the thoracic and lumbar spine (12.9\u2009%). The most frequent injuries while handling horses were foot injuries (17.2\u2009%), followed by head (16.6\u2009%) and mid-facial injuries (15.0\u2009%). With respect to the mechanism of injury accidents while riding were predominant (74\u2009%), while accidents when handling horses accounted for only 26\u2009%. The median ISS was 9.8 points. The proportion of multiple trauma patients (ISS >\u200916) was 18.1\u2009%. Based on the total sample, the average in-hospital patient stay was 5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4 days with a significantly higher proportion of hospitalized patients in the group of riding accidents. Fatal cases were not found in this study but the danger of riding is not to be underestimated. The large number of sometimes severe injuries with ISS values up to 62 points can be interpreted as an indication that recreational riding can easily result in life-threatening situations. \nCONCLUSION: Girls and young women could be identified as a group at particular risk. It has been demonstrated in this study that the three most common injury locations after falling from a horse were the head, the upper extremities, the thoracic and lumbar spine. The most frequent injury locations while handling horses were foot injuries, followed by head and mid-facial injuries."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[36, 36, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [50, 50, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [152, 152, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [158, 158, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [168, 168, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [169, 169, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [176, 176, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [181, 181, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [190, 190, \"C0817096;T029;261179002,51185008\", \"thoracic\"], [192, 193, \"C3887615;T029;122496007.C1284112;T023;361686005.C0024091;T023;73903008\", \"lumbar spine\"], [200, 200, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [209, 209, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [216, 216, \"C0817096;T029;261179002,51185008\", \"thoracic\"], [218, 219, \"C3887615;T029;122496007.C1284112;T023;361686005.C0024091;T023;73903008\", \"lumbar spine\"], [224, 224, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [229, 229, \"C1281587;T023;302545001.C0016504;T023;56459004\", \"foot\"], [230, 230, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [234, 234, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [238, 238, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [246, 246, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [271, 272, \"C0026771;T037;57028002,262519004,12835000\", \"multiple trauma\"], [308, 309, \"C0442737;T033;260415000\", \"not found\"], [328, 328, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [329, 329, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [347, 347, \"C0332219;T033;36203004\", \"easily\"], [378, 378, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [387, 387, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head,\"], [392, 392, \"C0817096;T029;261179002,51185008\", \"thoracic\"], [394, 395, \"C3887615;T029;122496007.C1284112;T023;361686005.C0024091;T023;73903008\", \"lumbar spine.\"], [399, 399, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [405, 405, \"C1281587;T023;302545001.C0016504;T023;56459004\", \"foot\"], [406, 406, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries,\"], [409, 409, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [412, 412, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[7, 7, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["56459004", "417163006", "73903008", "12835000", "24484000", "69536005", "260415000", "51185008", "57028002", "122496007", "36203004", "261179002", "361686005", "302545001", "417746004", "262519004", "302548004"], "id": "7ff93300-6604-4a34-8086-be18de3c5635", "_version_": 1673674961715200001}, {"title": ["Injury severities of truck drivers in single- and multi-vehicle accidents on rural highways."], "journal": "Accid Anal Prev", "journal_id": "1254476", "date": "2011-06-11T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "21658494", "abstract": ["In adverse driving conditions, such as inclement weather and/or complex terrain, trucks are often involved in single-vehicle (SV) accidents in addition to multi-vehicle (MV) accidents. Ten-year accident data involving trucks on rural highway from the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) is studied to investigate the difference in driver-injury severity between SV and MV accidents by using mixed logit models. Injury severity from SV and MV accidents involving trucks on rural highways is modeled separately and their respective critical risk factors such as driver, vehicle, temporal, roadway, environmental and accident characteristics are evaluated. It is found that there exists substantial difference between the impacts from a variety of variables on the driver-injury severity in MV and SV accidents. By conducting the injury severity study for MV and SV accidents involving trucks separately, some new or more comprehensive observations, which have not been covered in the existing studies can be made. Estimation findings indicate that the snow road surface and light traffic indicators will be better modeled as random parameters in SV and MV models respectively. As a result, the complex interactions of various variables and the nature of truck-driver injury are able to be disclosed in a better way. Based on the improved understanding on the injury severity of truck drivers from truck-involved accidents, it is expected that more rational and effective injury prevention strategy may be developed for truck drivers under different driving conditions in the future. \nCopyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant variables and their effects on the degree of injury are examined for earthmoving equipment using data from OSHA. Four types of equipment, backhoe, bulldozer, excavator, and scraper are included in the study. Accidents involving on-foot workers and equipment operators are investigated collectively, as well as separately. \nMETHODS: Cross tabulation analysis was conducted to establish the associations between selected categorical variables, using degree of injury as a dichotomous dependent variable (fatal vs. nonfatal) and a number of independent variables having different values. Odds ratios were calculated to determine how much a certain variable/factor increases the odds of fatality in an accident, and the odds ratios were ranked to determine the relative impact of a given factor. \nRESULTS: It was found that twelve variables were significantly associated with injury severity. Rankings based on odds ratios showed that inadequate safety training (2.54), missing equipment protective system (2.38), being a non-union worker (2.26), being an equipment operator (1.93), and being on or around inadequately maintained equipment (1.58) produced higher odds for fatality. \nCONCLUSION: A majority of the earthmoving equipment accidents resulted in fatality. Backhoes were the most common equipment involved in accidents and fatalities. Struck-by accidents were the most prevalent and most fatal. Non-OSHA compliant safety training, missing seatbelt, operator not using seatbelt, malfunctioning back-up alarms, and poorly maintained equipment were factors contributing to accidents and fatalities. On-foot workers experienced a higher number of accidents than operators, while fatality odds were higher for the operators. Practical applications: Safety professionals should benefit from our findings in planning and delivering training and providing oversight to workers in earthmoving equipment operations. \nCopyright \u00a9 2018 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

All of the patients had sustained severe brain injury and prolonged coma, i.e. lasting for at least 48 hours. The caregivers were interviewed by means of a Questionnaire that investigated several aspects of driving competence after coma and the incidence of road traffic accidents. \nMAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: All patient outcomes were evaluated by means of the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). The 90 caregivers reported that 29 patients (32%) had resumed driving and that 11 of the 29 (38%) were subsequently involved in road traffic accidents. During the total duration of our patient population risk exposure, we found 11 cases in our study group, against the 4.7 expected cases calculated in the normal population. The relative risk of road traffic accidents in severe brain injury patients versus uninjured individuals was 2.3. \nCONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data show that a subject who has suffered from severe brain injury and coma lasting for at least 48 hours has a statistically significant higher risk of being involved in a road traffic accident."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[16, 16, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [17, 17, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [18, 18, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury.\"], [38, 38, \"C0683278;T048;706873003\", \"suffering\"], [40, 40, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [41, 41, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [42, 42, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [51, 51, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [52, 52, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [53, 53, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [56, 56, \"C0009421;T047;371632003\", \"coma,\"], [81, 81, \"C0009421;T047;371632003\", \"coma\"], [140, 140, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure,\"], [167, 167, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [168, 168, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [169, 169, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [188, 188, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [189, 189, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [190, 190, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [192, 192, \"C0009421;T047;371632003\", \"coma\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[9, 9, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [10, 10, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [11, 11, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["371632003", "417163006", "706873003", "12738006", "417746004", "258335003", "71677004", "24484000"], "id": "5058d119-5bf5-4f21-881d-17997ffe52a6", "_version_": 1673673951447875588}, {"title": ["Propranolol for severe post-head injury action tremor."], "journal": "Neurology", "journal_id": "0401060", "date": "1978-02-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "564001", "abstract": ["Two children developed persistent, incapacitating, upper extremity tremor following severe head injury from bicycle-automobile collision accidents.

They frequently resulted in fractures and open wounds compared to other bicycle accidents. For intoxicated bicyclists, 95% were one-vehicle accidents, and injuries to the head constituted 63% of the injuries. \nDISCUSSION: One-vehicle accidents often result in severe injuries indicating a need for prevention.

Their mothers (n = 60) and fathers (n = 53) were assessed with the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale. \nRESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe PTSSs in children was 16.2% at 4-6 weeks, and 17.6% at 12 months. Mean PTSS scores did not decrease between the two assessments. Five children showed a delayed onset of PTSSs. Twelve mothers (20%) and six fathers (11.3%) met criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at 4 to 6 weeks. At 12 months, three mothers (5.7%) and no fathers met diagnostic criteria. Child PTSSs at 12 months was significantly predicted by PTSS at 4-6 weeks and by severity of father's PTSD.

We recorded demographic variables, clinical condition at admission, outcome, injury pattern, severity scores and survival probability by TRISS. \nRESULTS: Between 2004 and 2006 twelve patients who suffered an all-terrain vehicle accident were admitted. All of them were male and had a median age of 28.5 years (18-37.75). The median ISS was 25 points (17-27). Cranium and brain (AIS region 1) were present in 75% of the patients, face (AIS 2) in 41.6%, upper limbs (AIS 7) in 33%, thorax (AIS 4) in 25%, spine (AIS 6) and lower limbs (AIS 8) in 16.7% and there were no injures in AIS region 3 (neck) and 5 (abdomen-pelvis). Mortality at ICU and at day 28 was 16.7% and hospital mortality was 25%. Median ICU stay was 8 days (1.75-17) and median hospital stay was 21.5 days (8.25-27).

Two types of accidents that occur in work zones were: (a) construction work area accidents, and (b) traffic accidents involving construction worker(s). \nMETHODOLOGY/RESULTS: A detailed analysis of work zone accidents involving 36 fatalities and 3,055 severe injuries to construction workers on New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) construction projects from 1990 to 2001 established that five accident types: (a) Struck/Pinned by Large Equipment, (b) Trip or Fall (elevated), (c) Contact w/Electrical or Gas Utility, (d) Struck-by Moving/Falling Load, and (e) Crane/Lift Device Failure accounted for nearly 96% of the fatal accidents, nearly 63% of the hospital-level injury accidents, and nearly 91% of the total costs. These construction work area accidents had a total cost of $133.8 million. Traffic accidents that involve contractors' employees were also examined. Statistical analyses of the traffic accidents established that five traffic accident types: (a) Work Space Intrusion, (b) Worker Struck-by Vehicle Inside Work Space, (c) Flagger Struck-by Vehicle, (d) Worker Struck-by Vehicle Entering/Exiting Work Space, and (e) Construction Equipment Struck-by Vehicle Inside Work Space accounted for nearly 86% of the fatal, nearly 70% of the hospital-level injury and minor injury traffic accidents, and $45.4 million (79.4%) of the total traffic accident costs. \nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this paper provide real statistics on construction worker related accidents reported on construction work zones.

A worker, after a verbal animated dispute with some collegues and superiors, had an acute psychiatric agitation attack and went to the nearest emergency room, where he was subjected to clinical exams. No neuropsychiatric alteration was found, but the physicians diagnosed an anxiety crisis reactive to the work environment. Consequently, the medical certificate for work injury was edited and sent to INAIL. The worker has been off work for 110 days because of a anxious and depressive syndrome, due to the verbal conflict. In a later assessment, INAIL recognized only the first 30 days of the employee's time off as injury at work, while judging the following period off work as related to affectivity disturbance due to common disease, not related to work environment. The following year, \"anxious-depressive syndrome\" is worsened and attributed by the same worker to the recurrence of acts of persecution and discrimination against him at work. For this reason he applied for recognition of occupational disease diagnosed as \"Chronic Adjustment Disorder with prolonged depressive reaction and somatic anxiety, which developed into a protracted conflict marked the employment situation\". INAIL rejected that request, but in the same year the employee has submitted the complaint for \"mobbing\". Even this request was rejected. Literature shows many examples of traumatic events during working activities which cause psychiatric disturbances. These events include industrial disasters, explosions, transport and mining accidents, accidents in psychiatric units with high risks of assaults, armed conflicts, war, assault and sexual assault, natural disasters.

This study aims to address this gap and provide a basis and reference for motorcycle injury prevention. \nMethod: Medical record data was collected between October 2002 and June 2012 on all motorcycle injury patients admitted to a hospital in the city of Shantou of the east Guangdong province in China. Comparative analysis was conducted between patients in SV accidents and patients in MV accidents regarding demographic and clinic characteristics, mortality, and injury patterns. \nResults: Approximately 48% (n = 1977) of patients were involved in SV accidents and 52% (n = 2119) were involved in MV accidents. The average age was 34 years. Collision of a motorcycle with a heavy vehicle/bus (4%) was associated with a 34 times greater risk of death (RR: 34.32; 95% CI: 17.43-67.57). Compared to patients involved in MV accidents, those involved in SV accidents were more likely to sustain a skull fracture (RR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.22-1.77), an open head wound (RR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.23-1.74), an intracranial injury (RR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.26-1.53), a superficial head injury (RR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.01-1.86), an injury to an organ (RR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.24-3.26), and a crushing injury (RR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.06-3.70) to the thorax or abdomen. However, they were less likely to sustain a spinal fracture (RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.39-0.85), a pelvic fracture (RR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.11-0.46), an upper extremity fracture (RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.59-0.96), or injuries to their lower extremities, except for a dislocation, sprain, or injury to a joint or ligament (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.49-1.36). \nConclusion: The relative risk of death is higher for patients involved in multi-vehicle accidents than patients in single-vehicle accidents, especially when a collision involves mass vehicle(s). Injury to the head dominated motorcycle injuries. Single-vehicle accidents have a higher correlation with head injury or internal injuries to the thorax or abdomen. Multi-vehicle accidents are more correlated with extremity injuries, especially to the lower extremities or external trauma to the thorax or abdomen."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[25, 25, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [47, 48, \"C0150638;T061;275826003\", \"injury prevention.\"], [64, 64, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [103, 103, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [152, 152, \"C1306577;T033;268923008,397709008\", \"death\"], [176, 177, \"C0037304;T037;71642004\", \"skull fracture\"], [185, 185, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [186, 186, \"C0043250;T037;13924000,416462003\", \"wound\"], [193, 194, \"C0347535;T037;127296001\", \"intracranial injury\"], [202, 203, \"C0018674;T037;82271004\", \"head injury\"], [210, 210, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [221, 222, \"C0332679;T037;19921004,125665001\", \"crushing injury\"], [230, 230, \"C1269614;T023;302551006.C0817096;T029;261179002,51185008\", \"thorax\"], [232, 232, \"C1281594;T023;302553009.C0000726;T029;277112006,113345001\", \"abdomen.\"], [241, 242, \"C0080179;T037;50448004\", \"spinal fracture\"], [249, 250, \"C0149531;T037;77493009\", \"pelvic fracture\"], [257, 258, \"C1140618;T023;53120007\", \"upper extremity\"], [259, 259, \"C0016658;T037;125605004,72704001\", \"fracture\"], [266, 266, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [274, 274, \"C0012691;T037;87642003,108367008\", \"dislocation,\"], [275, 275, \"C0038045;T037;384709000\", \"sprain,\"], [277, 277, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [280, 280, \"C0022417;T030;39352004.C1269611;T030;302536002\", \"joint\"], [282, 282, \"C0023685;T024;52082005.C1269080;T023;182358004\", \"ligament\"], [293, 293, \"C1306577;T033;268923008,397709008\", \"death\"], [312, 312, \"C0577559;T033;4147007,300848003\", \"mass\"], [314, 314, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"Injury\"], [317, 317, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [320, 320, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries.\"], [328, 329, \"C0018674;T037;82271004\", \"head injury\"], [331, 332, \"C0332675;T037;105612003\", \"internal injuries\"], [335, 335, \"C1269614;T023;302551006.C0817096;T029;261179002,51185008\", \"thorax\"], [337, 337, \"C1281594;T023;302553009.C0000726;T029;277112006,113345001\", \"abdomen.\"], [344, 344, \"C0015385;T023;66019005\", \"extremity\"], [345, 345, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries,\"], [353, 353, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"trauma\"], [356, 356, \"C1269614;T023;302551006.C0817096;T029;261179002,51185008\", \"thorax\"], [358, 358, \"C1281594;T023;302553009.C0000726;T029;277112006,113345001\", \"abdomen.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[14, 14, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"Injury\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["125665001", "302551006", "105612003", "108367008", "4147007", "417746004", "71642004", "51185008", "52082005", "384709000", "72704001", "416462003", "69536005", "300848003", "125605004", "277112006", "66019005", "53120007", "182358004", "275826003", "127296001", "397709008", "50448004", "82271004", "302548004", "19921004", "261179002", "13924000", "39352004", "113345001", "87642003", "417163006", "302536002", "302553009", "77493009", "268923008"], "id": "301bd4c6-adb5-470c-a0b8-c7a5dbe975d0", "_version_": 1673675336135475201}, {"title": ["A case of air-bag associated severe ocular injury."], "journal": "Korean J Ophthalmol", "journal_id": "8804513", "date": "2004-07-17T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "15255243", "abstract": ["Air-bags have received widespread support as an effective means of enhancing automotive safety, and they are becoming more common as standard automobile equipment on many cars.

A systematic analysis of all off-road truck-related accidents, injuries, and illnesses, which are reported and published by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), is expected to provide practical insights for identifying the accident patterns and trends in the available raw database. Therefore, appropriate safety management measures can be administered and implemented based on these accident patterns/trends. \nMETHODS: A hybrid clustering-classification methodology using K-means clustering and gene expression programming (GEP) is proposed for the analysis of severe and non-severe off-road truck-related injuries at U.S. mines. Using the GEP sub-model, a small subset of the 36 recorded attributes was found to be correlated to the severity level. \nRESULTS: Given the set of specified attributes, the clustering sub-model was able to cluster the accident records into 5 distinct groups. For instance, the first cluster contained accidents related to minerals processing mills and coal preparation plants (91%). More than two-thirds of the victims in this cluster had less than 5years of job experience. This cluster was associated with the highest percentage of severe injuries (22 severe accidents, 3.4%). Almost 50% of all accidents in this cluster occurred at stone operations. Similarly, the other four clusters were characterized to highlight important patterns that can be used to determine areas of focus for safety initiatives. \nCONCLUSIONS: The identified clusters of accidents may play a vital role in the prevention of severe injuries in mining. Further research into the cluster attributes and identified patterns will be necessary to determine how these factors can be mitigated to reduce the risk of severe injuries. \nPRACTICAL APPLICATION: Analyzing injury data using data mining techniques provides some insight into attributes that are associated with high accuracies for predicting injury severity. \nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd and National Safety Council.

The mortality was significantly related to social deprivation; excluding eight children injured while on holiday in the region, 15-fold decrease in mortality was recorded between the local authority wards that ranked highest on the overall deprivation index and those that ranked lowest (14.0/100,000 children, group 10 v 0.9/100,000, group 1 respectively, p less than 0.00001). \nCONCLUSIONS: The finding that most accidents occurred in children living in deprived areas who were playing unsupervised near their home suggests that childhood mortality might be appreciably reduced if children at play were protected from traffic, particularly in socially deprived areas."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[11, 11, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [12, 12, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [27, 27, \"C0004398;T060;29240004,168461002\", \"necropsy\"], [50, 50, \"C1306577;T033;268923008,397709008.C1546956;T033;419099009\", \"died\"], [53, 54, \"C0018674;T037;82271004\", \"head injury\"], [62, 62, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [72, 72, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [116, 116, \"C1306577;T033;268923008,397709008.C1546956;T033;419099009\", \"died\"], [119, 120, \"C0018674;T037;82271004\", \"head injury,\"], [137, 138, \"C0018674;T037;82271004\", \"head injury\"], [155, 155, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[6, 7, \"C0018674;T037;82271004\", \"head injury\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["96005000", "82271004", "397709008", "69536005", "29240004", "412307009", "268923008", "302548004", "417746004", "168461002", "419099009", "417163006"], "id": "f3527b05-2027-47b6-ba72-d56906514d3a", "_version_": 1673673242102988832}, {"title": ["Injury pattern analysis of helicopter wire strike accidents (-Gz load)."], "journal": "Aviat Space Environ Med", "journal_id": "7501714", "date": "1985-12-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "4084179", "abstract": ["Injury patterns in rotary wing aircraft wire strike accidents were reviewed to determine mechanisms of injury.

Updated data on all military rotary wing aircraft accidents investigated between 1978 and 1982 were screened by the Division of Aerospace Pathology to determine the mechanisms of injury to flight deck personnel. From 13 December 1978 to 23 June 1982, three types of rotary wing aircraft were in eight fatal accidents. These mishaps accounted for 28 casualties: 14 fatalities and 14 injuries. Aviators comprised 64.4% of the fatalities. Injury pattern analysis showed 100% had major head and neck injuries with 66% having basilar skull fractures. Two-thirds had associated mandibular fractures or evidence of impact forces transmitted through the mandible to the skull. The same number had wedge-shaped chin lacerations from impact with the cyclic control stick.

Degree of physical injury predicted more PTSD symptoms, and previous accident experiences predicted fewer symptoms, before and after controlling for other variables.

The aim of this research was to investigate the correlation between specific injury patterns and fatal outcome in other participants of traffic-related accidents. \nMETHODS: This was a retrospective study of traffic-related accidents in the broader area of the city of Osijek in a five-year period from 1995 to 1999. Autopsy results from the Institute of Pathology and Forensic Medicine of the Clinical Hospital Centre Osijek were analysed of individuals who died after their accident. The total severity of injuries was measured using the ISS. Logistic regression analysis was used for assessing the correlation between specific injury patterns and an early outcome from the severe injury. \nRESULTS: There were 213 individuals included in the study: 72 pedestrians and 141 other participants (drivers, assistant drivers, passengers, cyclists and motorcyclists). A total of129 individuals died on the spot and 84 died in the hospital during the first 48h. Femoral and pelvic fracture, fatal triad and both variants of ipsilateral dyad were related to higher ISS values. Ipsilateral fracture of upper and lower extremities (ipsilateral dyad 1) was associated with a 4.59 times higher risk of an immediate fatal outcome in the total sample. In pedestrians, the risk was 5.99 higher, and in other participants, the risk was 4.11 times higher. \nCONCLUSION: Specific skeletal injuries and injury patterns are a significant indicator for total injury severity and related poor prognosis for all participants of traffic-related injuries, not only for pedestrians. In this study, the ipsilateral fracture of upper and lower extremity was related to the largest total severity of injuries and the poorest prognosis. \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
