Three types of back pain questionnaire (Oswestry Low Back Pain Score, Aberdeen Low Back Pain Scale, and Acute Low Back Pain Screeing Questionnaire) were randomly assigned to the examinees. The authors reviewed lumbar imaging studies (simple lumbar radiographs, lumbar computed tomography, and magnetic resolutional images), and the severity of lumbar disc herniation was categorized according to the guidelines issued by the Korean military directorate. We calculated the relationship between the back pain questionnaire scores and the severity of lumbar disc herniation. \nRESULTS: The scores of back pain questionnaires increased according to the severity of lumbar disc herniation. But, the range of scores was very vague, so it is less predictable to detect lumbar disc herniation using only back pain questionnaires. The sensitivity between the back pain questionnaires and the presence of lumbar disc herniation was low (16-64%). \nCONCLUSION: Screening of lumbar disc herniation using only back pain questionnaires has limited value."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[6, 7, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [10, 11, \"C1305431;T023;244576006\", \"lumbar disc\"], [12, 12, \"C0220908;T060;20135006\", \"screening\"], [24, 25, \"C1305431;T023;244576006\", \"lumbar disc\"], [26, 26, \"C0220908;T060;20135006\", \"screening\"], [28, 29, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [37, 38, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain.\"], [42, 43, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [46, 48, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"Low Back Pain\"], [48, 49, \"C0582148;T033;225908003\", \"Pain Score,\"], [51, 53, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"Low Back Pain\"], [56, 59, \"C0457950;T184;278862001\", \"Acute Low Back Pain\"], [71, 71, \"C0024090;T029;52612000,264082005\", \"lumbar\"], [72, 72, \"C0011923;T060;363679005\", \"imaging\"], [75, 75, \"C0024090;T029;52612000,264082005\", \"lumbar\"], [77, 77, \"C0024090;T029;52612000,264082005\", \"lumbar\"], [78, 79, \"C0040405;T060;77477000\", \"computed tomography,\"], [88, 89, \"C1305431;T023;244576006\", \"lumbar disc\"], [90, 90, \"C0019270;T190;414403008\", \"herniation\"], [109, 110, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [117, 118, \"C1305431;T023;244576006\", \"lumbar disc\"], [119, 119, \"C0019270;T190;414403008\", \"herniation.\"], [124, 125, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [133, 134, \"C1305431;T023;244576006\", \"lumbar disc\"], [135, 135, \"C0019270;T190;414403008\", \"herniation.\"], [151, 152, \"C1305431;T023;244576006\", \"lumbar disc\"], [153, 153, \"C0019270;T190;414403008\", \"herniation\"], [156, 157, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [160, 160, \"C0427965;T033;365705006\", \"sensitivity\"], [163, 164, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [170, 171, \"C1305431;T023;244576006\", \"lumbar disc\"], [172, 172, \"C0019270;T190;414403008\", \"herniation\"], [177, 177, \"C0220908;T060;20135006\", \"Screening\"], [179, 180, \"C1305431;T023;244576006\", \"lumbar disc\"], [181, 181, \"C0019270;T190;414403008\", \"herniation\"], [184, 185, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 1, \"C1305431;T023;244576006\", \"Lumbar disc\"], [2, 2, \"C0220908;T060;20135006\", \"screening\"], [4, 5, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [8, 10, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [10, 11, \"C0582148;T033;225908003\", \"pain score,\"], [13, 15, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [18, 21, \"C0457950;T184;278862001\", \"acute low back pain\"], [22, 22, \"C0220908;T060;20135006\", \"screening\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["225908003", "52612000", "279039007", "363679005", "77477000", "244576006", "414403008", "161891005", "20135006", "365705006", "278862001", "264082005"], "id": "67ef9b09-430f-4d69-8082-ebdf2c48240b", "_version_": 1673674915481387008}, {"title": ["Adolescent back pain."], "journal": "Curr Opin Pediatr", "journal_id": "9000850", "date": "2008-01-17T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "18197037", "abstract": ["PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adolescent back pain poses a distinct diagnostic challenge to the physician due to skeletal maturity and activity levels seen in adolescent patients. The purpose of this review is to focus on the musculoskeletal causes of adolescent back pain and to review the current literature on the etiology, diagnosis and treatment options. \nRECENT FINDINGS: Etiologies of adolescent back pain include a vast differential diagnosis, including traumatic, morphologic, infectious and neoplastic etiologies. Recent literature has focused on spondylolysis, back pack-related pain, disc herniations and back pain in adolescent athletes. Recent anatomic studies have demonstrated a distinct morphology to spondylytic spines attributing the etiology of spondylolysis in part to morphologic predispositions. \nSUMMARY: Increasing numbers of active adolescents will lead to increasing complaints of back pain seen by the primary care physician. Recent epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between adolescent back pain and adult-onset back pain.

More pragmatic approaches start with the separation of the serious from the less serious, and the distinction between spinal pain and pain arising from outside the spine.

This study compared clinical pain profiles, pain sensitivity, as well as pronociceptive and antinociceptive mechanisms in patients with localized low back pain (n\u00a0=\u00a018), localized neck pain (n\u00a0=\u00a017), low back and radiating leg pain (n\u00a0=\u00a018), or neck and radiating arm pain (n\u00a0=\u00a017). It was hypothesized that patients with radiating pain had facilitated pain mechanisms and impaired pain inhibition compared with localized pain patients. Cuff algometry was performed on the nonpainful lower leg to assess pressure pain threshold, tolerance, temporal summation of pain (increase in pain scores to 10 repeated stimulations at pressure pain tolerance intensity), and conditioning pain modulation (increase in pressure pain threshold during pain conditioning on the contralateral leg). Heat detection and heat pain threshold at the nonpainful hand were also assessed. Clinical pain intensity, psychological distress, and disability were assessed with questionnaires. Temporal summation of pain was increased in patients with radiating back pain compared with localized back pain (P\u00a0<\u00a0.03). Patients with radiating arm pain or localized low back pain demonstrated hyperalgesia to heat and pressure in nonpainful body areas (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), as well as well as a facilitated clinical pain profile compared with patients with localized neck pain (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03).

The consequence of delayed recognition, referral, and decompression may be permanent neurologic deficit. Fortunately, this event is rare. Certain other warning signs and symptoms (as outlined in Fig. 1) should alert the clinician to possible systemic disease and warrant earlier, more aggressive evaluation. Careful history-taking and focused physical examination remain the cornerstones of clinical decision making in managing the geriatric patient with back pain. Laboratory and/or radiologic studies are indicated in carefully defined circumstances. Advanced age, independent of other risk factors, is probably not an indication for obtaining roentgenograms and laboratory studies as part of the initial screening of patients with back complaints. Available epidemiologic studies suggest that the predicament as well as the illness of back pain is common in the elderly, and that most people who suffer from back pain in old age had back complaints before the age of 65. Furthermore, although back complaints are among the most commonly mentioned symptoms by elderly patients to their physicians, they are less often the chief or presenting complaint. Studies that examine the reasons for health-care-seeking behavior in older patients with back pain, or that compare older and younger patients in this regard, are lacking. Several factors potentially contribute to age-related differences in patient behavior related to back pain. The removal of employment compensation issues in the postretirement population may alter the relative frequency of physician visits. A higher incidence of serious chronic and/or life-threatening disease in the elderly, as well as perceived threats to independent function, may heighten anxiety about back pain. Conversely, because of the greater prevalence of musculoskeletal and other activity-limiting conditions in the elderly, older patients may believe that back pain is just another burden of aging.

The WHO-COPCORD epidemiologic investigations have established its prevalence even in countries that had been unaware of its frequency in their populace, and factors involving type of work and training probably accounted for this misperception. Medical journals are replete with articles addressing diagnosis and treatment, but the majority fail to meet the standards needed for metaanalysis or comparison. A task force of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research of the United States Department of Health and Human Services screened more than 10,000 abstracts, eliminated the majority of these studies and papers, and still was unable to recommend the best approach even to acute back pain; the problem of subacute and chronic back pain is even more formidable. Yet back pain has been identified as perhaps the major cause of disability and absenteeism from the workplace worldwide. WHO chiefly addressed subacute back pain, as most acute back pain is self-limited and ends spontaneously, almost regardless of the treatment. Subacute pain is the intermediate stage toward chronic pain, which defies most treatments. Specific causes for back pain, such as infections, tumors, osteoporosis, spondyloarthropathies, and trauma, actually represent a minority of such pain syndromes, qualifying for specific therapeutic approaches. A major problem in defining the burden of disease for back pain has been a dearth of agreed-upon outcome measures by which to judge the various interventions, and this was the task that the WHO Low Back Pain Initiative took upon itself. Among measures recommended to be included in all studies, so that valid comparisons could be made, were measurement of pain by visual analog scales, somatic perception, the Oswestry disability and modified Zung questionnaires, and a modified Schober test of spinal mobility. These measures are needed for studies, not for diagnosis or treatment of individual patients. They have been translated into various major languages and validated by back-translations, and applied in comparative studies in various cultures to medical, chiropractic, and other common interventions. The importance of such scientifically sound studies cannot be overemphasized, as the costs of health care are mounting everywhere and it therefore becomes imperative to develop cost-effective approaches. All the more so as conversion of acute back pain to chronic back pain is often iatrogenic, with strong psychosocial factors as well, so that not only what to do but also what not to do become important public health issues. The general lack of attention to back pain by governments and organizations probably results from the fact that it is perceived as a syndromic presentation with myriad causes rather than as a specific disease entity. Even if the \"disease\" names classify like presentations but are not necessarily etiologically discrete, syndromic diagnoses that subsume a variety of causes receive less attention; international rankings of common disabilities and public health problems tend to emphasize the named disorders rather than the grouped disorders.

Some occupational risk factors (namely, heavy manual material handling) may also contribute to the development of low-back pain: due to the high prevalence of both low-back pain and manual material handling in the adult working population, it has been estimated that low-back pain is probably the most common occupational disorder worldwide. Lifetime prevalence of low-back pain has been reported to be as high as 84%, depending on the case definition used, and no age group is spared, even children. Although low-back pain is not a lethal condition, it was estimated at the third rank among all diseases by disability-adjusted life-years in 2010 in the USA, after ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and at the first rank by years lived with disability. It also ranked high (13th) globally for the same year, in disability-adjusted life-years. Low-back pain is currently classified as nonspecific/specific as to putative cause and as acute (lasting less than 6 weeks), subacute (6-12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks) according to duration of symptoms. The distinction between nonspecific/specific and acute/subacute/chronic low-back pain is useful not only for epidemiologic studies, but also (mainly) for choosing the appropriate strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder. Workplace risk factors for low-back pain include manual lifting and whole-body vibration exposure.

In relation to back pain that radiates to the leg, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) states: \"Pain in the lower limb should be described specifically as either referred pain or radicular pain. In cases of doubt no implication should be made and the pain should be described as pain in the lower limb.\" \nRECENT FINDINGS: Bogduks' editorial in the journal PAIN (2009) helps us to differentiate and define the terms somatic referred pain, radicular pain, and radiculopathy. In addition, there are other pathologies distal to the nerve root that could be relevant to patients with back pain and leg pain such as plexus and peripheral nerve involvement. Hence, the diagnosis of back pain with leg pain can still be challenging. In this article, we present a patient with back and leg pain. The patient appears to have a radicular pain syndrome, but has no neurological impairment and shows signs of myofascial involvement. Is there a single diagnosis or indeed two overlapping syndromes? The scope of our article encompasses the common diagnostic possibilities for this type of patient. A discussion of treatment is beyond the scope of this article and depends on the final diagnosis/diagnoses made."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[8, 10, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [15, 16, \"C0023216;T023;61685007.C1269079;T023;182281004\", \"lower limb\"], [16, 17, \"C0030196;T184;90834002\", \"limb pain\"], [24, 25, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [30, 30, \"C1269079;T023;182281004.C0023216;T023;61685007.C1140621;T023;30021000.C1285009;T029;362793004\", \"leg,\"], [38, 38, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"Pain\"], [41, 41, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"\\\"Pain\"], [44, 45, \"C0023216;T023;61685007.C1269079;T023;182281004\", \"lower limb\"], [52, 53, \"C0234250;T184;6617009\", \"referred pain\"], [55, 56, \"C0278147;T184;11679003\", \"radicular pain.\"], [68, 68, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain\"], [73, 73, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain\"], [85, 85, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"PAIN\"], [96, 97, \"C0234250;T184;6617009\", \"referred pain,\"], [98, 99, \"C0278147;T184;11679003\", \"radicular pain,\"], [111, 112, \"C0228084;T023;40958000\", \"nerve root\"], [120, 121, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [123, 124, \"C0023222;T184;10601006\", \"leg pain\"], [129, 130, \"C0031119;T023;84782009.C1280200;T023;244457007\", \"peripheral nerve\"], [134, 134, \"C0011900;T060;439401001\", \"diagnosis\"], [136, 137, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [139, 140, \"C0023222;T184;10601006\", \"leg pain\"], [153, 153, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [155, 156, \"C0023222;T184;10601006\", \"leg pain.\"], [163, 164, \"C0278147;T184;11679003\", \"radicular pain\"], [170, 170, \"C0684336;T046;40226000\", \"impairment\"], [181, 181, \"C0011900;T060;439401001\", \"diagnosis\"], [185, 185, \"C0185027;T061;24846002\", \"overlapping\"], [203, 203, \"C0557061;T061;223482009\", \"discussion\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 1, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back Pain\"], [3, 4, \"C0023222;T184;10601006\", \"Leg Pain.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["40958000", "77568009", "244457007", "182281004", "24846002", "11679003", "279039007", "40226000", "362793004", "22253000", "161891005", "439401001", "6617009", "223482009", "61685007", "10601006", "90834002", "84782009", "30021000"], "id": "4e9afcff-2ffa-4172-96a0-a74302b754bc", "_version_": 1673675244818137093}, {"title": ["Low back pain."], "journal": "Am Fam Physician", "journal_id": "1272646", "date": "1986-03-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "2937281", "abstract": ["Low back pain is a frequent source of disability during the productive years of life.

[Subjects and Methods] A total of 166 outpatients (116 female, 50 male) with chronic low back pain presenting for physical therapy participated in this study. Patients were divided into two groups: those with low back pain alone and those with both low back pain and radicular pain. Pain intensity and lumbar disability were measured using a visual analogue scale and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Psychological factors, such as self-efficiency, fear avoidance, and depression were measured using the Chronic Pain Self-efficacy Scale, Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, and Beck Depression Index, respectively. [Results] Patients with low back pain with radicular pain had greater pain and lumber disability and lower psychological factors compared with patients with chronic low back pain alone. [Conclusion] Our findings indicate the presence of low back pain with radicular pain is more related to pain, LBP disability index, Back performance, Self-efficiency (Pain, Function, Symptom), Fear-avoidance (body, work) and depression factors than low back pain. Considering the relationships between in pain, LBP disability index, Back performance, Self-efficiency (Pain, Function, Symptom), Fear-avoidance (body, work) and depression factors in patients with low back pain, therapeutic intervention for not only pain and dysfunction, but also psychological factors is needed."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[7, 7, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain\"], [10, 10, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"disability,\"], [17, 19, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain.\"], [33, 36, \"C0457949;T047;278860009\", \"chronic low back pain\"], [40, 40, \"C0087111;T061;277132007,276239002\", \"therapy\"], [53, 55, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [61, 63, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [65, 66, \"C0278147;T184;11679003\", \"radicular pain.\"], [67, 67, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"Pain\"], [70, 70, \"C0024090;T029;52612000,264082005\", \"lumbar\"], [71, 71, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"disability\"], [82, 82, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"Disability\"], [92, 92, \"C0011581;T048;35489007\", \"depression\"], [97, 98, \"C0150055;T184;82423001\", \"Chronic Pain\"], [106, 106, \"C0011581;T048;35489007\", \"Depression\"], [112, 114, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [116, 117, \"C0278147;T184;11679003\", \"radicular pain\"], [120, 120, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain\"], [123, 123, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"disability\"], [132, 135, \"C0457949;T047;278860009\", \"chronic low back pain\"], [144, 146, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [148, 149, \"C0278147;T184;11679003\", \"radicular pain\"], [154, 154, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain,\"], [156, 156, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"disability\"], [158, 158, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"Back\"], [161, 161, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"(Pain,\"], [168, 168, \"C0011581;T048;35489007\", \"depression\"], [171, 173, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain.\"], [179, 179, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain,\"], [181, 181, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"disability\"], [183, 183, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"Back\"], [186, 186, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"(Pain,\"], [193, 193, \"C0011581;T048;35489007\", \"depression\"], [198, 200, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain,\"], [202, 202, \"C1273869;T058;225334002\", \"intervention\"], [206, 206, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain\"], [208, 208, \"C0277785;T046;386585008\", \"dysfunction,\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[2, 2, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain,\"], [3, 3, \"C0012634;T047;64572001\", \"disorder,\"], [4, 4, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [12, 14, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [16, 17, \"C0278147;T184;11679003\", \"radicular pain.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["52612000", "278860009", "264082005", "386585008", "35489007", "225334002", "276239002", "11679003", "22253000", "77568009", "64572001", "21134002", "277132007", "279039007", "82423001"], "id": "fd2dc492-d3b7-4eca-9838-b0159e700968", "_version_": 1673675332080631813}, {"keyword": ["antidepressants anticonvulsants.", "back pain", "non-opioid analgesics", "opioid analgesics"], "title": ["[Back pain treatment]."], "journal": "Cas Lek Cesk", "journal_id": "0004743", "date": "2018-05-24T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "29790353", "abstract": ["Spine pain is one of the most common medical problems.

The present study sought to document the incidence and severity of back pain among echocardiographers, and to identify personal, lifestyle and occupational characteristics that may predict risk of back pain. \nDESIGN: A questionnaire concerning occupational, personal, and lifestyle characteristics, as well as the extent and severity of back pain was completed and returned by 183 echocardiographers. \nRESULTS: The standard echocardiography examination position of \"machine on the left, patient on the right, and transducer held in the right hand\" (used by 66% of respondents) greatly increased the risk of back pain (odds ratio (OR) = 4.9; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.49-16.4). Echocardiographers with more than 11 years experience in the field were also at risk of back pain (OR) = 3.4; 95% CI = 0.97-11.6). The intensity of back pain was strongly associated with the amount of time spent on echocardiography examinations (P = 0.035), limitation of lifestyle (P < or = 0.001), and interference with work (P < or = 0.001). There was a significantly higher relative risk of back pain for the respondents whose job involved frequent or occasional lifting compared with nonlifters (P = 0.01; OR = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.25-18.7). At least some limitation of lifestyle from back pain was reported by 56% of the respondents. \nCONCLUSIONS: There is a high incidence of back pain among echocardiographers, and specific tasks and activities increase the risk of back pain.

The surveys included questions concerning back pain before the subjects' college career, back pain during intercollegiate rowing, missed practices, the duration of time lost from college rowing because of back pain, and career-ending back pain. Back pain was defined as pain lasting longer than 1 week. \nRESULTS: More subjects with preexisting back pain developed back pain during their college rowing career than subjects without preexisting back pain (57.1% versus 36.6%). Of those with preexisting pain, 55% missed practice because of back pain and 8% ended their college rowing careers; for those without preexisting pain, the percentages were 62% and 17%, respectively. For subjects with pain before their college rowing career, 78.8% missed less than 1 week and 5.9% missed more than 1 month. For subjects with no preexisting pain, 61.9% missed less than 1 week and 18.1% missed more than 1 month. \nCONCLUSIONS: While rowers with preexisting back pain are more likely to have back pain in college, they are less likely to miss extended periods of practice time or end their college rowing careers because of back pain. \nCopyright 2003 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine"], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[1, 2, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back pain\"], [14, 15, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [19, 20, \"C0035648;T033;80943009\", \"risk factor\"], [22, 23, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [59, 60, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [66, 67, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [83, 84, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain,\"], [87, 88, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain.\"], [89, 90, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back pain\"], [94, 94, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain\"], [105, 106, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [108, 109, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [119, 120, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [128, 128, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain,\"], [134, 135, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [147, 147, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain,\"], [158, 158, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain\"], [182, 182, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain,\"], [201, 202, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [208, 209, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [231, 232, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[3, 4, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [11, 12, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["161891005", "80943009", "22253000"], "id": "c1ccfc84-05a8-4338-9db4-a0af98fc0cbc", "_version_": 1673673778485264411}, {"title": ["Back pain in children."], "journal": "Curr Opin Pediatr", "journal_id": "9000850", "date": "1994-02-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "8205183", "abstract": ["This article describes a quick, straightforward examination for back pain in children.

Descriptive analyses of data from two surveys, 1988-89 and 1992-93, estimated prevalence and new onset of back pain. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Poisson regression, adjusted for age and gender. \nRESULTS: Prevalence of disabling and non-disabling back pain was 6 and 23%, respectively. While prevalence of non-disabling back pain did not vary significantly across age (\u03c7\u00b2trend : 0.90; P = 0.34), the prevalence of disabling back pain increased with age (\u03c7\u00b2trend : 4.02; P = 0.04).

From these, poor self-rated health, previous back pain and depressive symptoms were found to be independent predictors of pain onset. Markers of social networks were not associated with the reporting of back pain onset. Conclusion. The risk of disabling back pain rises in older age.

It is believed that most episodes of low back pain will be short-lived and that 80% to 90% of attacks of low back pain resolve in about 6 weeks, irrespective of the administration or type of treatment. However, multiple studies in the late 90s showed recurrent or chronic low back pain, evaluated at 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months, ranging from 35% to 79%. Risk factors of low back pain are multifactorial, with many possible etiologies. Multiple risk factors of low back pain and lower-extremity pain include physical factors, social demographic characteristics, habits, and psychosocial factors. This review will discuss the epidemiology of low back pain, with emphasis on frequency, causes, and consequences of low back pain; the influence of age, gender, morphologic characteristics, and genetics; and the influence of occupational, mechanical, social, habitual, and psychological factors."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[0, 2, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"Low back pain\"], [17, 17, \"C0012634;T047;64572001\", \"disorder\"], [33, 35, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"Low back pain\"], [59, 61, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [92, 94, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [106, 108, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [120, 122, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [146, 149, \"C0457949;T047;278860009\", \"chronic low back pain,\"], [167, 169, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [180, 182, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [185, 185, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain\"], [203, 205, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain,\"], [214, 216, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain;\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[2, 4, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["278860009", "279039007", "22253000", "64572001"], "id": "762663ce-ac98-476f-be26-72bc36dcc816", "_version_": 1673674042725367808}, {"title": ["Managing acute low back pain."], "journal": "Drug Ther Bull", "journal_id": "0112037", "date": "1999-11-24T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "10562763", "abstract": ["Back pain is very common.

In Germany, about 70% of adults have at least one episode of back pain per year. \nMETHODS: This review is based on a selective literature search and on the German National Disease Management Guideline for Low Back Pain. \nRESULTS: The physician taking the history from a patient with back pain should ask about the nature, onset, course, localization, and radiation of the pain and its dependence on physical activity and/or emotional stress. In the differential diagnosis, neurologic deficits and any \"red flags\" suggesting dangerous conditions such as spinal fracture, bacterial infection, and tumors must be ruled out. If no specific cause of the pain can be identified, no imaging studies are indicated on initial presentation. The treatment of acute, nonspecific low back pain focuses on pain relief and functional improvement. Adequate patient education and counseling are essential. Exercise therapy is no more effective than the continuation of normal daily activities.

These surveys concerned training methods and back pain before and during intercollegiate rowing. Back pain was defined as pain that lasted at least 1 week. \nRESULTS: Five hundred twenty-six subjects reported that back pain developed during intercollegiate rowing. Factors significantly associated with the development of back pain included age at the time of the survey; history of rowing before age 16; use of a hatchet oar blade; training with free weights, weight machines, and an ergometer; midline ergometer cable position; and ergometer training sessions longer than 30 minutes. Back pain while in college also was associated with higher mean college weight and height. \nCONCLUSIONS: Intercollegiate rowers in the last 10 years covered by this study were larger, started rowing at an earlier age, trained more intensely, and developed more back pain during college than their predecessors. \nCopyright 2002 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine"], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[1, 2, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back pain\"], [27, 28, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [50, 50, \"C0220931;T065;118629009\", \"training\"], [53, 54, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [60, 61, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back pain\"], [65, 65, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain\"], [79, 80, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [92, 93, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [102, 103, \"C0262926;T033;392521001\", \"history of\"], [114, 114, \"C0220931;T065;118629009\", \"training\"], [129, 129, \"C0220931;T065;118629009\", \"training\"], [135, 136, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back pain\"], [176, 177, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 1, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back pain\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["392521001", "161891005", "22253000", "118629009"], "id": "806def41-fbaa-46ac-b010-a9684b3fc2b4", "_version_": 1673673778798788623}, {"title": ["Back pain: osteoarthritis."], "journal": "J Am Geriatr Soc", "journal_id": "7503062", "date": "1977-02-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "137924", "abstract": ["Back pain is one of the chief complaints of the elderly.

The pain is usually mild, localized in the low back, rarely radiates to the lower extremities, and has a duration of only a few days. The risk factors for development of back pain include the lithotomy position, multiple attempts at block placement, duration of surgery longer than 2.5 hours, body mass index \u226532 kg/m, and a history of back pain. However, there is no permanent worsening of preexisting back pain after neuraxial anesthesia. The back pain has been attributed to tears in the ligaments, fascia, or bone with localized bleeding; immobility of the spine; relaxation of the paraspinal muscles under anesthesia; flattening of the normal lumbar convexity; and stretching and straining of the lumbosacral ligaments and joint capsules. The addition of an anti-inflammatory drug to the local anesthetic used for skin infiltration may decrease the incidence and severity of back pain. The use of spinal or epidural anesthesia in the adult, non-obstetric and obstetric populations should depend on the advantages offered by the technique and not on the occurrence of back pain after the procedure. Additional studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of epidural dexamethasone, or other steroids, or the addition of an anti-inflammatory drug to the local anesthetic infiltration for the prevention of back pain after neuraxial anesthesia.

It occurs most commonly after the sixth month and can last until the sixth month postpartum. The major predictors are back pain prior to pregnancy and multiparity. Several biomechanical and physiologic changes during pregnancy contribute to back pain. As the woman's abdominal muscles are stretched and tone is diminished, they lose their ability to contribute to neutral posture. During pregnancy, production of the hormone relaxin increases ten-fold. The hormone creates joint laxity, which not only allows the pelvis to accommodate the enlarging uterus, but also weakens the ability of static supports in the lumbar spine to withstand shearing forces. In the pelvis, joint laxity is most prominent in the symphysis pubis and the sacroiliac joints. On physical exam, neither lumbar nor sacroiliac back pain is generally associated with any evidence of neurologic deficit or hip pathology. In cases of lumbar back pain, the physical exam will be most consistent with discogenic pain and/or facet element pain.

It occurs in similar proportions in all cultures, interferes with quality of life and work performance, and is the most common reason for medical consultations. Few cases of back pain are due to specific causes; most cases are non-specific. Acute back pain is the most common presentation and is usually self-limiting, lasting less than three months regardless of treatment. Chronic back pain is a more difficult problem, which often has strong psychological overlay: work dissatisfaction, boredom, and a generous compensation system contribute to it. Among the diagnoses offered for chronic pain is fibromyalgia, an urban condition (the diagnosis is not made in rural settings) that does not differ materially from other instances of widespread chronic pain.

The questionnaire was distributed to current employees of fire and police departments. The survey was completed by 129 fire fighters (68% of the active force) and 346 police officers (74% of the force). \nRESULTS: 36% of the respondents complained of a back problem. The prevalence increased from 13% among men aged 19 to 28 to 47% among men aged 49 to 59. The complaint was more common among firefighters (42%) than among police officers (33%). In a logistic regression analysis, back problems were significantly associated with the duration of employment, cigarette smoking, and the number of children. \nCONCLUSIONS: Back pain is a multifactorial problem with significant impact on the working population.

In contrast, low-back pain during menstruation is significantly correlated with labour pain scores recorded for back and front contraction pain as well as for continuous back pain.

Some individuals never have low back pain, but most have it on and off or persistently. Thus, the low back pain 'condition' is usually a lifelong experience. However, subgroups of patients with different back pain trajectories have been identified and linked to clinical parameters. Further investigation is warranted to understand causality, treatment effect and prognostic factors and to study the possible association of trajectories with pathologies.  \nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A topic guide was used to steer the interview and themes were extracted from the data. \nRESULTS: Thirteen key themes were revealed; seven of these related to issues of satisfaction with physiotherapy and are described elsewhere. The six themes considered here dealt with the participants' experience of and attitudes to back pain and its management. Themes were: the impact of back pain on their life; perspectives about back pain; its management; their involvement in its management; what strategies they had for self-management; and expectations about the episode of physiotherapy beforehand. \nCONCLUSIONS: In this group of participants with a history of back pain and physiotherapy treatment a common finding was a degree of acceptance of the back pain problem and the belief that patient involvement in management was essential.

We tested whether individual differences in endogenous opioid inhibition of chronic low-back pain were associated with the magnitude of acute reductions in back pain ratings after morphine administration. \nMETHODS: In randomized counterbalanced order over three sessions, 50 chronic low-back pain patients received intravenous naloxone (8 mg), morphine (0.08 mg/kg), or placebo. Back pain intensity was rated predrug and again after peak drug activity was achieved using the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form (Sensory and Affective subscales, VAS Intensity measure). Opioid blockade effect measures to index degree of endogenous opioid inhibition of back pain intensity were derived as the difference between predrug to postdrug changes in pain intensity across placebo and naloxone conditions, with similar morphine responsiveness measures derived across placebo and morphine conditions. \nRESULTS: Morphine significantly reduced back pain compared with placebo (McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form Sensory, VAS; P < 0.01). There were no overall effects of opioid blockade on back pain intensity. However, individual differences in opioid blockade effects were significantly associated with the degree of acute morphine-related reductions in back pain on all measures, even after controlling for effects of age, sex, and chronic pain duration (P < 0.03). Individuals exhibiting greater endogenous opioid inhibition of chronic back pain intensity reported less acute relief of back pain with morphine. \nCONCLUSIONS: Morphine appears to provide better acute relief of chronic back pain in individuals with lower natural opioidergic inhibition of chronic pain intensity.

Back schools are frequently used in the treatment of low back pain patients. \nOBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of back schools for patients with non-specific low back pain. \nSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Medline and Embase databases up to December 1997 and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register up to December 1998 if reported in English, Dutch, French or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified randomised trials. \nSELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomised trials that reported on any type of back school for non-specific low back pain were included. \nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers blinded with respect to authors, institution and journal independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality. Our preset \"high quality\" level was 6 or more out of 11 internal validity criteria with positive scores. As data were statistically and clinically too heterogeneous, a qualitative review (best evidence synthesis) was performed. The evidence was classified into 4 levels (strong, moderate, limited or no evidence) taking into account the methodological quality of the studies. \nMAIN RESULTS: Fifteen RCTs were included in our systematic review. Overall, the methodological quality was low. Only 3 trials were considered high quality. It was not possible to make relevant subgroup analyses for radiation versus no radiation or to have a relevant subgroup of studies reporting on acute low back pain only. The results indicate that there is moderate evidence that back schools have better short-term effects than other treatments for chronic low back pain, and that there is moderate evidence that back schools in an occupational setting are more effective compared to 'placebo' or waiting list controls. \nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Back schools may be effective for patients with recurrent and chronic low back pain in occupational settings, but little is known about the cost-effectiveness of back schools."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[7, 7, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [14, 14, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [24, 24, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"Back\"], [33, 35, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [50, 50, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [56, 58, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain.\"], [113, 113, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [117, 119, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [160, 160, \"C1446409;T033;10828004\", \"positive\"], [245, 245, \"C0700287;T058;223458004\", \"reporting\"], [247, 250, \"C0457950;T184;278862001\", \"acute low back pain\"], [261, 261, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [271, 274, \"C0457949;T047;278860009\", \"chronic low back pain,\"], [282, 282, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [300, 300, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"Back\"], [310, 313, \"C0457949;T047;278860009\", \"chronic low back pain\"], [325, 325, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"Back\"], [4, 6, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["279039007", "77568009", "223458004", "278862001", "278860009", "10828004"], "id": "2a1ab09d-f33e-4d42-a654-959fdbddc071", "_version_": 1673673646996979717}, {"title": ["[Therapeutic algorithm for low back pain]."], "journal": "Rev Med Brux", "journal_id": "8003474", "date": "2015-11-24T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "26591318", "abstract": ["Low back pain (LBP) has become one of the greatest public health problems.

We also identified 10 generic tools proposed to assess outcome in low back pain, which are more conceptually linked to perceived health status, quality of life, and pain assessment. \nCONCLUSION: A \"gold standard\" to evaluate disability in low back pain does not exist, but only 4 tools (the Dallas Pain Questionnaire, Roland Disability Questionnaire, Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale and Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) demonstrated strong qualities (content and construct validity, feasibility, linguistic adaptation and international use)."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[5, 7, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [8, 9, \"C0278372;T060;12894003\", \"functional assessment\"], [34, 36, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain,\"], [40, 40, \"C1261322;T058;129265001,386053000\", \"assessment,\"], [77, 77, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"Disability\"], [80, 80, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"Pain\"], [83, 84, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back Pain\"], [88, 89, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back Pain\"], [114, 116, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [154, 156, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain,\"], [166, 168, \"C0518214;T184;405152002\", \"quality of life,\"], [170, 171, \"C0030198;T060;225399009\", \"pain assessment.\"], [174, 174, \"C0018026;T121,T196;2309006,767325001\", \"\\\"gold\"], [178, 178, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"disability\"], [180, 182, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"low back pain\"], [192, 192, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"Pain\"], [195, 195, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"Disability\"], [198, 199, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back Pain\"], [200, 200, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"Disability\"], [204, 206, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"Low Back Pain\"], [207, 207, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"Disability\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[1, 2, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [3, 3, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"disability\"], [4, 4, \"C1261322;T058;129265001,386053000\", \"assessment\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["225399009", "279039007", "405152002", "21134002", "22253000", "161891005", "129265001", "12894003", "386053000", "767325001", "2309006"], "id": "7764be9a-ef1d-4e84-bc2e-06b4f6a1e6bd", "_version_": 1673673955905372160}, {"title": ["Low back pain (acute)."], "journal": "BMJ Clin Evid", "journal_id": "101294314", "date": "2011-05-10T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "21549023", "abstract": ["INTRODUCTION: Low back pain affects about 70% of people in resource-rich countries at some point in their lives. Acute low back pain can be self-limiting; however, 1 year after an initial episode, as many as 33% of people still have moderate-intensity pain and 15% have severe pain. Acute low back pain has a high recurrence rate; 75% of those with a first episode have a recurrence. Although acute episodes may resolve completely, they may increase in severity and duration over time. \nMETHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral drug treatments for acute low back pain? What are the effects of local injections for acute low back pain? What are the effects of non-drug treatments for acute low back pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). \nRESULTS: We found 49 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. \nCONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, advice to stay active, analgesics (paracetamol, opioids), back exercises, back schools, bed rest, behavioural therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, epidural corticosteroid injections, lumbar supports, massage, multidisciplinary treatment programmes, muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), spinal manipulation, temperature treatments (short-wave diathermy, ultrasound, ice, heat), traction, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[1, 3, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"Low back pain\"], [18, 21, \"C0457950;T184;278862001\", \"Acute low back pain\"], [41, 41, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"pain\"], [45, 46, \"C0278140;T033;76948002\", \"severe pain.\"], [47, 50, \"C0457950;T184;278862001\", \"Acute low back pain\"], [102, 102, \"C4521986;T033;738956005\", \"oral\"], [108, 108, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [120, 120, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [132, 132, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [180, 181, \"C0150270;T058;182832007.C3469597;T061;18629005\", \"Drug Administration\"], [238, 238, \"C0394664;T061;44868003\", \"acupuncture,\"], [239, 240, \"C0150600;T058;420227002\", \"advice to\"], [244, 244, \"C0000970;T109,T121;90332006,387517004\", \"(paracetamol,\"], [246, 247, \"C0454348;T061;229138000\", \"back exercises,\"], [248, 248, \"C1995000;T029;77568009\", \"back\"], [252, 253, \"C0004933;T061;166001\", \"behavioural therapy,\"], [254, 255, \"C0204624;T061;36430006\", \"electromyographic biofeedback,\"], [259, 259, \"C0024090;T029;52612000,264082005\", \"lumbar\"], [272, 272, \"C0947647;T061;19207007,129408000\", \"manipulation,\"], [276, 276, \"C0012002;T061;428381003,21825005\", \"diathermy,\"], [277, 277, \"C0041618;T060;16310003,278292003\", \"ultrasound,\"], [278, 278, \"C0020746;T197;896008\", \"ice,\"], [280, 280, \"C0040597;T061;66391000,129411004\", \"traction,\"], [282, 285, \"C0040654;T061;229559001,432061000124105\", \"transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 2, \"C0024031;T184;279039007\", \"Low back pain\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["16310003", "36430006", "66391000", "229138000", "129408000", "738956005", "19207007", "52612000", "182832007", "278862001", "18629005", "22253000", "428381003", "896008", "432061000124105", "420227002", "129411004", "387517004", "264082005", "166001", "76948002", "229559001", "278292003", "21825005", "90332006", "77568009", "279039007", "44868003"], "id": "9a71f057-be11-4297-b893-e881aecee4fd", "_version_": 1673674441458974729}, {"title": ["Neuropathic low back pain."], "journal": "Curr Pain Headache Rep", "journal_id": "100970666", "date": "2005-05-24T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "15907254", "abstract": ["In this discussion, we hope to advance a clinical approach to low back pain that is more in line with our modern understanding of neuropathic pain.

Prescription pain medications from drug claims were used to stratify to five unique intensity levels. The characteristics of each level were determined using regression models. \nResults: About 10% had musculoskeletal back pain. Of these, 54% (N\u2009=\u200920,645) had new back pain and 46% (N\u2009=\u200917,252) had recurring back pain. Overall, about 35% received physical therapy. Pain medication intensity levels included no prescription pain medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, low-dose opioids, and high-dose opioids (new back pain: 39%, 10%, 6%, 23%, and 23%, respectively; recurring back pain 32%, 9%, 4%, 17%, and 38%, respectively). NSAID and muscle relaxant users were younger, healthier, and received physical therapy. Opioid users were younger, in poorer health, used sleep medications, received physical therapy, and had more falls and higher health care utilization and expenditures. \nConclusions: \u2002New and recurring back pain patients can be stratified by pain medication intensity to review treatment patterns and target back pain prevention programs. Those with back pain but taking no prescription pain medications may benefit from back pain prevention programs.

A standard textbook of obesity was also utilized as a source of basic science of obesity. \nCONCLUSION: Our review of these articles revealed a possible association between obesity and low back pain only in the upper quintile of obesity, and no evidence of a temporal relationship between weight change and low back pain change. The studies reviewed failed to differentiate low back pain patients by diagnosis and failed to quantify the possible presence of emotional factors in obese low back pain patients. As an incidental finding, one study documented a significant correlation between smoking history and low back pain. We concluded that there is no evidence in the current literature to support obesity that is not in the highest quintile as a cause of low back pain.

Low back and neck-shoulder pain and subjective fatigue intensity was assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS) before and after driving. Lumbar paraspinal and trapezius muscle activation during driving was measured by surface EMG. Vibration pain provocation test was applied for all subjects. Average paraspinal myoelectric activity during driving was approximately 1% of MVC in both groups. Average trapezius myoelectric activity during driving was from 2 to 4% of MVC. Trapezius muscle activity was higher in back healthy drivers than in those with LBP. The low back support had no effect either on paraspinal or trapezius EMG activity. Low back and neck-shoulder fatigue increased during driving in both groups especially in those subjects with positive vibration pain provocation. The neck-shoulder pain and fatigue were more severe in drivers suffering from LBP. Low back support had no effect on low back and neck-shoulder subjective fatigue and neck-shoulder pain but tended to limit the LBP increase during driving. Paraspinal muscle loading in urban bus drivers was very limited and either LBP or ergonomic low back support had no effect on it.

The impact of that perturbation is limited via anticipatory postural adjustments. The strategy by which the CNS controls anticipatory postural adjustments of the trunk muscles during limb movement is altered during acute back pain and in people with recurrent back pain, even when they are pain free. The altered postural strategy probably serves to protect the spine in the short term, but it is associated with a cost and is thought to predispose spinal structures to injury in the long term. It is not known why this protective strategy might occur even when people are pain free, but one possibility is that it is caused by the anticipation of back pain. In eight healthy subjects, recordings of intramuscular EMG were made from the trunk muscles during single and repetitive arm movements. Anticipation of experimental back pain and anticipation of experimental elbow pain were elicited by the threat of painful cutaneous stimulation. There was no effect of anticipated experimental elbow pain on postural adjustments. During anticipated experimental back pain, for single arm movements there was delayed activation of the deep trunk muscles and augmentation of at least one superficial trunk muscle. For repetitive arm movements, there was decreased activity and a shift from biphasic to monophasic activation of the deep trunk muscles and increased activity of superficial trunk muscles during anticipation of back pain.

Pain-related fear has typically been measured by self-report instruments. In this study, we developed and validated a Behavioral Avoidance Test (BAT) for chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients with the aim of assessing pain-related avoidance behavior by direct observation. \nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The BAT-Back was administered to a group of CLBP patients (N=97) and pain-free controls (N=31). Furthermore, pain, pain-related fear, disability, catastrophizing, and avoidance behavior were measured using self-report instruments. Reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient and Cronbach \u03b1. Validity was assessed by examining correlation and regression analysis. \nRESULTS: The intraclass correlation coefficient for the BAT-Back avoidance score was r=0.76. Internal consistency was \u03b1=0.95. CLBP patients and controls differed significantly on BAT-Back avoidance scores as well as self-report measures. BAT-Back avoidance scores were significantly correlated with scores on each of the self-report measures (rs=0.27 to 0.54). They were not significantly correlated with general anxiety and depression, age, body mass index, and pain duration. The BAT-Back avoidance score was able to capture unique variance in disability after controlling for other variables (eg, pain intensity and pain-related fear). \nDISCUSSION: Results indicate that the BAT-Back is a reliable and valid measure of pain-related avoidance behavior.

Baseline data were obtained from the women and obstetrical and anaesthetic data from the hospital chart. Women were contacted by phone at four to six weeks post-partum and questioned regarding the presence of any back pain and pain lasting longer than 14 days. \nRESULTS: Three hundred women entered the study and follow-up was obtained in 270 (90%). The incidence of back pain was 30.7% and back pain lasting longer than 14 days was 8.5%. Nulliparity was associated with a decreased risk of developing back pain post-partum but this decrease was only associated with pain lasting more than 14 days: Odds Ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval] 0.32 [0.11-0.94].

Back pain is closely (but not invariably) associated with structural pathology such as intervertebral disc prolapse and endplate fractures, although age-related biochemical changes such as those revealed by a 'dark disc' on MRI have little clinical relevance. All features of structural pathology (including disc prolapse) can be re-created in cadaveric specimens by severe or repetitive mechanical loading, with a combination of bending and compression being particularly harmful to the spine. Structural disruption alters the mechanical environment of disc cells in a manner that leads to cell-mediated degenerative changes, and animal experiments confirm that surgical disruption of a disc is followed by widespread disc degeneration. Some people are more vulnerable to spinal degeneration than others, largely because of their genetic inheritance. Age-related biochemical changes and loading history can also affect tissue vulnerability. Finally the concept of 'functional pathology' is introduced, according to which, back pain can arise because postural habits generate painful stress concentrations within innervated tissues, even though the stresses are not high enough to cause physical disruption."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[7, 8, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [29, 29, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [31, 33, \"C0740418;T184;134407002\", \"chronic back pain\"], [39, 39, \"C0024090;T029;52612000,264082005\", \"lumbar\"], [40, 40, \"C0442106;T029;264042003\", \"intervertebral\"], [44, 44, \"C0392905;T022;81087007\", \"joints,\"], [47, 47, \"C0555898;T029;264185005\", \"sacroiliac\"], [48, 48, \"C0392905;T022;81087007\", \"joints.\"], [55, 56, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [68, 69, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [74, 75, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"Back pain\"], [87, 89, \"C0242362;T020;73589001\", \"intervertebral disc prolapse\"], [106, 106, \"C0024485;T060;113091000,312250003\", \"MRI\"], [118, 118, \"C0033377;T047;29696001\", \"prolapse)\"], [126, 126, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [143, 143, \"C1267072;T023;44300000\", \"spine.\"], [167, 167, \"C0543467;T061;387713003,257556004,83578000\", \"surgical\"], [177, 177, \"C0011164;T046;107669003,33359002\", \"degeneration.\"], [184, 185, \"C0850918;T047;762305005\", \"spinal degeneration\"], [199, 199, \"C0262926;T033;392521001\", \"history\"], [203, 203, \"C0040300;T024;85756007\", \"tissue\"], [216, 217, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain\"], [224, 224, \"C0030193;T184;22253000\", \"painful\"], [225, 225, \"C0038435;T033;262188008,73595000\", \"stress\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[2, 3, \"C0004604;T184;161891005\", \"back pain.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["85756007", "52612000", "312250003", "107669003", "81087007", "44300000", "73589001", "113091000", "387713003", "83578000", "73595000", "22253000", "29696001", "134407002", "24484000", "264042003", "161891005", "33359002", "392521001", "262188008", "264185005", "257556004", "762305005", "264082005"], "id": "1eee58fb-7892-4e31-835e-ca2e9ff3ba5f", "_version_": 1673673923309338626}]}, "facet_counts": {"facet_queries": {}, "facet_fields": {"snomed_codes": ["22253000", 332096, "257556004", 137978, "387713003", 137978, "83578000", 137978, "77568009", 110653, "439401001", 78667, "276239002", 59649, "277132007", 59649, "129265001", 52994, "386053000", 52994, "24484000", 52960, "417746004", 43967, "289928003", 40379, "21522001", 39691, "392521001", 39004, "10828004", 36563, "372087000", 32968, "86049000", 32968, "405152002", 32797, "373265006", 31579, "53009005", 31579, "363346000", 30521, "82423001", 30480, "225334002", 30058, "182970005", 28758, "38433004", 28338, "260385009", 27941, "128530007", 26265, "113091000", 26152, "312250003", 26152, "108369006", 25909, "363679005", 25870, "129326001", 25742, "59108006", 25742, "385218009", 25724, "29857009", 25465, "21134002", 25127, "113345001", 24726, "277112006", 24726, "90780006", 24642, "128303001", 24277, "129304002", 24277, "129306000", 24277, "65801008", 24277, "417163006", 24268, "300848003", 24220, "4147007", 24220, "87612001", 23550, "738956005", 23340, "189822004", 23254, "191415002", 23254, "40733004", 23254, "365705006", 22258, "39937001", 22209, "181469002", 22179, "268923008", 22074, "397709008", 22074, "213299007", 21244, "116223007", 21134, "85756007", 20604, "110465008", 20404, "278414003", 20320, "77477000", 20111, "161891005", 20024, "4421005", 20010, "362837007", 19984, "16310003", 19733, "278292003", 19733, "768465000", 19698, "88878007", 19698, "361291001", 19642, "72696002", 19641, "279039007", 19504, "26036001", 19367, "35489007", 19278, "52925006", 19231, "122545008", 19008, "129272000", 19008, "262188008", 18801, "73595000", 18801, "52988006", 18726, "131148009", 18672, "50960005", 18672, "261179002", 18487, "404642006", 18487, "51185008", 18487, "386661006", 18196, "50177009", 18196, "13543005", 18039, "225655006", 18010, "396275006", 18010, "39352004", 17966, "23583003", 17958, "257552002", 17958, "302536002", 17940, "116647005", 17644, "371153006", 17178, "224978009", 17013, "373873005", 16960, "410942007", 16960]}, "facet_ranges": {}, "facet_intervals": {}, "facet_heatmaps": {}}}
