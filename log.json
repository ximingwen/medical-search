We calculated the positive predictive value, comparing registration in the DPCRR with the original medical records, and captured data on stressful life events. Two general practitioners were queried about 50 patients without a stress diagnosis in the DPCRR, regarding whether they had ever received a stress diagnosis. \nRESULTS: The positive predictive value was 58% for acute stress reaction, 83% for posttraumatic stress disorder, 94% for adjustment disorder, 71% for other reactions to severe stress, and 68% for reaction to severe stress, unspecified.

They require a skillful adaptation and may be the cause of stress. Stress of considerable intensity can receive the joy of life and even lead to a temporary mental disorder. \nTHE AIM OF THE STUDY: To present the main causes and frequency of disturbance determined according to the ICD-10 as a reaction to severe stress and adaptive disorders among patients in psychiatric and psychological counseling and to establish whether the causes of the disorder are dependent on factors such as age, sex or level of education. \nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis was done on a separate group of 754 persons from among patients seeking psychiatric counseling--Psychological Outpatient Mental Health in the 10th Military Clinical Hospital in Bydgoszcz, in 2005. This group were qualified person, who according to the criteria of ICD-10 were found to respond to severe stress and abnormal adaptation. In addition, during the interview determines whether they are long-term somatic illness. They have not been included in the study group. Also excluded persons who were found difficulties in operation prior to the stressful situation and those that have already been treated with psychiatric or psychological benefit from therapy. The collected data were statistically analyzed. \nRESULTS: The analysis identifies three main causes of adjustment disorder. The first group of reasons is related to difficulties in the workplace, which represents 59% of all patients with the disorder described. In this group identifies three major stressful situations: bullying, job loss, unemployment. Another reason relates to family problems. They are the reason for the emergence of abnormalities in 23% of patients analyzed group. Among these difficulties was divided into four main types of situation causing disorder presented. There are family conflicts, death of spouse, parent death, divorce. The last group of factors are stressful events or incidents which contributed to the disorder in 16% of patients in the group described. In this category were observed four major groups analyzed the causes of the disorder. This is due to the difficulty of adapting to the compulsory military service, traffic accidents, participation in missions abroad, the situation of rape. Making a detailed analysis by category of difficulty is shown that in this group of subjects, age, educational level and gender are significant factors in influencing the formation of these disorders. \nCONCLUSION: The main causes of this disorder are closely related to everyday human activity and especially on employment. Harassment and bad relationships in the workplace, job loss, unemployment are the factors most often causing disorder in question.

The aims of the present cohort study were to examine the cumulative incidence of traumatic events and psychiatric diagnoses following diagnoses of severe stress and adjustment disorders categorized using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and to examine associations of these diagnoses with all-cause mortality and suicide. Data came from a longitudinal cohort of all Danes who received a diagnosis of reaction to severe stress or adjustment disorders (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code F43.x) between 1995 and 2011, and they were compared with data from a general-population cohort. Cumulative incidence curves were plotted to examine traumatic experiences and psychiatric diagnoses during the study period. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine the associations of the disorders with mortality and suicide. Participants with stress diagnoses had a higher incidence of traumatic events and psychiatric diagnoses than did the comparison group. Each disorder was associated with a higher rate of all-cause mortality than that seen in the comparison cohort, and strong associations with suicide were found after adjustment. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the associations of stress disorders with a variety of outcomes, and we found that stress diagnoses may have long-lasting and potentially severe consequences.  \nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 2015.

The aim of the present descriptive and observational study was to analyze injury severity depending on the seating position during HEMS accidents in Germany. \nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from the German Federal Agency for Flight Accident Investigation was gathered for a period of 40 years (from 1970 to 2009). The seating position in the aircraft during the accident and the resulting injury severity (i.e., 1=no; 2=slight; 3=severe; and 4=fatal) were recorded. Injury severity was compared using the Fisher's exact test. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. \nRESULTS: A total of n=99 accidents were investigated (n=61 accidents did not lead to any injuries in the occupants, n=7 accidents resulted in minor, and n=6 in severe injuries, and lethal injuries resulted from n=15 accidents). The occupant in the \"patient\" position was most likely to suffer from deadly injuries (44.9%), followed by the HEMS crew member rear seat (25.0%), compared to lower lethality rates in the other seating positions (9.4-11.2%). Sitting on the HEMS crew member rear seat also was associated with the highest percentage of severe and minor injuries (12.5% each). \nCONCLUSIONS: In HEMS accidents, the patients' position and the HEMS crew member rear seat were found to be at the highest risk for fatal or severe injuries. These results support the urgent requirement of a large international data base for HEMS accidents as a basis for further studies to improve the safety in HEMS missions. \nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis of accident victim characteristics showed that all age groups are at risk, and that most victims were young adult men vehicle drivers with experience and wearing helmets. Spinal injury levels were cervical, three; thoracic, three; and thoracolumbar, six. Categorized accident hazard patterns were loss of control, six; tipover, four; and hidden obstacle, two.

All except 1 eye (9 of 10) were diagnosed with total or near-total ocular surface failure. Limbal stem cell transplantation was performed in 8 of 10 eyes. Keratolimbal allograft was followed by penetrating keratoplasty in 7 of 10 eyes. Ocular surface stability was achieved in 7 of 10 eyes after keratolimabl allograft. Postoperative visual acuity was better than 20/200 in 4 of 10 of eyes. Keratolimbal graft rejection occurred in 3 of 10 eyes; the rate of rejection of penetrating keratoplasty was also 3 out of 10 eyes. \nCONCLUSIONS: Methamphetamine-related accidents can lead to severe bilateral ocular injuries.

The marital relationships of moderate (n = 31) and severe (n = 17) head injury (HI) groups and a spinal cord injury (SCI) group (n = 24) were assessed through spouses' self-reports in interview and through standardized questionnaires. Analyses indicated that the three groups were not statistically different in age, number of months post-injury, pre- and post-injury occupational status, and level of income. In the post-injury marital relationship, the severe HI group was significantly lower than the moderate HI and SCI groups on standardized and validated scales assessing affectional expression (p less than 0.002), dyadic satisfaction (p less than 0.001), dyadic cohesion (p less than 0.01), and total dyadic adjustment (p less than 0.001). On a scale of social role functioning, the severe HI group's performance was significantly lower than the moderate HI and SCI groups (p less than 0.005).

The participants had spinal cord injury or multiple traumas. \nDESIGN: Classification into the three trajectories was based on symptoms of psychological distress (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and negative affect) and participants' level of positive affect at admission to and discharge from the rehabilitation hospital. \nRESULTS: The most common trajectory was the resilience trajectory (54%), followed by the recovery trajectory (25%) and the distress trajectory (21%). The most interesting differences between the trajectories were the result of optimism, affect, social support, and pain. Trait negative and positive affect predicted classification into the trajectories. \nCONCLUSIONS: An adaptation pattern characterized by resilience was found to be the most common response to an acquired severe injury, and trait affect predicts the outcome pattern.

The questionnaire included questions about the incidence of bicycle-related accidents and subsequent injury within a year, the degree of injury and presence or absence of reporting that injury (bicycle-related accident) to the police. For the bicycle-related accident, we asked regarding both riding and pedestrian accidents (i.e., accidents caused by a bicycle when walking). \nRESULTS: Excluding the blank responses (n=3539, 50.0%), the targets for analysis were 3098 older adults in riding accidents and 2861 older adults in pedestrian accidents. The results showed that 63.0% of older adults (n=1953) routinely rode a bicycle. Among them, 9.4% (n=184) experienced riding accidents, and 3.4% (n=98) experienced pedestrian accidents caused by a bicycle. For the riding accidents, 76.1% (n=140) had some injuries, and for the pedestrian accidents, 55.1% (n=54) had some injuries. Furthermore, in 70.2% (n=59) and 76.9% (n=20) of riding and pedestrian accidents, respectively, those who went to the hospital for treatment of their injury (i.e., injury requiring treatment) did not report the accident to the police. \nCONCLUSION: The present study revealed that there are many potential bicycle-related accidents in older adults.

This paper investigates the incidence of PTSD after traffic accidents in Germany. Data from an accident research unit were analyzed in regard to collision details, and preclinical and clinical data. Preclinical data included details on crash circumstances and estimated injury severity as well as data on victims' conditions (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, consciousness, breath rate). Clinical data included initial assessment in the emergency department, radiographic diagnoses, and basic life parameters comparable to the preclinical data as well as follow-up data on the daily ward. Data were collected in the German-In-Depth Accident Research study, and included gender, type of accident (e.g. type of vehicle, road conditions, rural or urban area), mental disorder, and AIS (Abbreviated Injury Scale) head score. AIS represent a scoring system to measure the injury severity of traffic accident victims. A total 258 out of 32807 data sets were included in this analysis. Data on accident and victims was collected on scene by specialized teams following established algorithms. Besides higher AIS Head scores for male motorcyclists compared to all other subgroups, no significant correlation was found between the mean maximum AIS score and the occurrence of PTSD. Furthermore, there was no correlation between higher AIS head scores, gender, or involvement in road traffic accidents and PTSD. In our study the overall incidence of PTSD after road traffic accidents was very low (0.78% in a total of 32.807 collected data sets) when compared to other published studies. The reason for this very low incidence of PTSD in our patient sample could be seen in an underestimation of the psychophysiological impact of traffic accidents on patients.

Significant differences with respect to various risk factors including driver, vehicle, environmental, road geometry and traffic characteristics were found to exist between urban and rural models. For example, in rural accidents involving tractor-trailer combinations, the probability of drivers' injuries being severe/fatal increased about 26% relative to accidents involving single-unit trucks. In urban areas, this same probability increased nearly 700%. In accidents where alcohol or drug use was identified as being the primary cause of the accident, the probability of severe/fatal injury increased roughly 250% percent in rural areas and nearly 800% in urban areas. While many of the same variables were found to be significant in both rural and urban models (although often with quite different impact), there were 13 variables that significantly influenced driver-injury severity in rural but not urban areas, and 17 variables that significantly influenced driver-injury severity in urban but not rural areas.

The presence of post-traumatic stress disorder was not related to the type of accident, age of the child, or the nature of injuries but was significantly associated with sex, previous experience of trauma, and subjective appraisal of threat to life.

All patients had severe limbal stem cell deficiency with total ocular surface failure. Eight eyes received a conjunctival-limbal autograft (CLAU) with a keratolimbal allograft (KLAL), 1 eye received a living related-conjunctival limbal allograft (lr-CLAL) with a KLAL, and 2 eyes received a CLAU with lr-CLAL. Nine eyes underwent subsequent penetrating keratoplasty, and 7 eyes had reconstructive eyelid surgery. Nine eyes demonstrated improved visual acuity at last follow-up; seven eyes demonstrated a stable ocular surface at last follow-up. Nonadherence was noted in 7 patients, either with poor adherence with post-operative treatment or poor follow-up; this portended a worse visual result. \nCONCLUSIONS: Roman candle-related accidents can lead to severe ocular surface injury.

A worker, after a verbal animated dispute with some collegues and superiors, had an acute psychiatric agitation attack and went to the nearest emergency room, where he was subjected to clinical exams. No neuropsychiatric alteration was found, but the physicians diagnosed an anxiety crisis reactive to the work environment. Consequently, the medical certificate for work injury was edited and sent to INAIL. The worker has been off work for 110 days because of a anxious and depressive syndrome, due to the verbal conflict. In a later assessment, INAIL recognized only the first 30 days of the employee's time off as injury at work, while judging the following period off work as related to affectivity disturbance due to common disease, not related to work environment. The following year, \"anxious-depressive syndrome\" is worsened and attributed by the same worker to the recurrence of acts of persecution and discrimination against him at work. For this reason he applied for recognition of occupational disease diagnosed as \"Chronic Adjustment Disorder with prolonged depressive reaction and somatic anxiety, which developed into a protracted conflict marked the employment situation\". INAIL rejected that request, but in the same year the employee has submitted the complaint for \"mobbing\". Even this request was rejected. Literature shows many examples of traumatic events during working activities which cause psychiatric disturbances. These events include industrial disasters, explosions, transport and mining accidents, accidents in psychiatric units with high risks of assaults, armed conflicts, war, assault and sexual assault, natural disasters. Victims show symptoms of acute stress disorder (ASD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Many of these victims are pedestrians. The present retrospective study analyzes the severity and mortality of injuries suffered by adult pedestrians, depending on whether they used a zebra crosswalk. \nMETHODS: Our retrospective data analysis covered adult patients admitted to our emergency department (ED) between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2012 after being hit by a vehicle while crossing the road as a pedestrian. Patients were identified by using a string term. Medical, police and ambulance records were reviewed for data extraction. \nRESULTS: A total of 347 patients were eligible for study inclusion. Two hundred and three (203; 58.5%) patients were on a zebra crosswalk and 144 (41.5%) were not. The mean ISS (injury Severity Score) was 12.1 (SD 14.7, range 1-75). The vehicles were faster in non-zebra crosswalk accidents (47.7 km/n, versus 41.4 km/h, p<0.027). The mean ISS score was higher in patients with non-zebra crosswalk accidents; 14.4 (SD 16.5, range 1-75) versus 10.5 (SD13.14, range 1-75) (p<0.019). Zebra crosswalk accidents were associated with less risk of severe injury (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.98, p<0.042). Accidents involving a truck were associated with increased risk of severe injury (OR 3.53, 95%CI 1.21-10.26, p<0.02). \nCONCLUSION: Accidents on zebra crosswalks are more common than those not on zebra crosswalks. The injury severity of non-zebra crosswalk accidents is significantly higher than in patients with zebra crosswalk accidents.

The aim of this paper is to survey the injury mechanism of intracerebral hemorrhage in vehicle accidents, including contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), subdural hematoma (SDH) and diffuse axonal injury (DAI). \nMETHODS: A condensed overview is given based on the published studies in biomechanical studies on intracerebral hemorrhage. Animal tests, cadaver tests, accident investigations and numerical simulation are the main method used for the mechanism studies. \nRESULTS: Angular velocity and acceleration can be used to predict these injuries and they are the main causation of DAI. Intracranial pressure is the main causation of coup/contrecoup contusion. Shear stress and strain contribute to the rupture of bridging veins that result in SDH, SAH. \nCONCLUSION: Injury mechanism of intracerebral hemorrhage in vehicle accidents is complicated that with multiple causations. In-depth works need to be carried out in mechanism studies especially for child head injuries. \nCopyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[1, 2, \"C2937358;T046;274100004\", \"Intracerebral hemorrhage\"], [9, 9, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [11, 11, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"], [22, 22, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [25, 26, \"C2937358;T046;274100004\", \"intracerebral hemorrhage\"], [28, 28, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"], [31, 31, \"C0009938;T037;308492005,125667009\", \"contusion,\"], [32, 33, \"C0038525;T047;21454007\", \"subarachnoid hemorrhage\"], [35, 36, \"C0018946;T046;35486000,95453001\", \"subdural hematoma\"], [41, 41, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [58, 59, \"C2937358;T046;274100004\", \"intracerebral hemorrhage.\"], [62, 62, \"C0006629;T017;261244009\", \"cadaver\"], [65, 65, \"C1261322;T058;129265001,386053000\", \"investigations\"], [89, 89, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [98, 98, \"C0524466;T029;303231004\", \"Intracranial\"], [99, 99, \"C0460139;T033;13543005\", \"pressure\"], [106, 106, \"C0009938;T037;308492005,125667009\", \"contusion.\"], [108, 108, \"C0038435;T033;262188008,73595000\", \"stress\"], [110, 110, \"C0080194;T037;48532005\", \"strain\"], [114, 114, \"C3203359;T037;125671007\", \"rupture\"], [124, 124, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"Injury\"], [127, 128, \"C2937358;T046;274100004\", \"intracerebral hemorrhage\"], [130, 130, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"], [151, 151, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [152, 152, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[3, 3, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"Injury\"], [6, 7, \"C2937358;T046;274100004\", \"Intracerebral Hemorrhage\"], [9, 9, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"Vehicle\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["21454007", "129265001", "308492005", "13543005", "69536005", "412307009", "417746004", "261244009", "48532005", "417163006", "302548004", "274100004", "96005000", "35486000", "73595000", "303231004", "125667009", "125671007", "386053000", "95453001", "262188008"], "id": "dac9f694-9fd8-4229-9a1b-95ec1e141696", "_version_": 1673675142350241793, "score": 59.378014}, {"title": ["Severe physical exertion, oxidative stress, and acute lung injury."], "journal": "Clin J Sport Med", "journal_id": "9103300", "date": "2011-11-09T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "22064719", "abstract": ["We report the case of a 27-year-old male athlete presenting with severe dyspnoea 24 hours after completing an \"Ironman Triathlon.\" Subsequent chest radiology excluded pulmonary embolus but confirmed an acute lung injury (ALI).

All of the patients had sustained severe brain injury and prolonged coma, i.e. lasting for at least 48 hours. The caregivers were interviewed by means of a Questionnaire that investigated several aspects of driving competence after coma and the incidence of road traffic accidents. \nMAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: All patient outcomes were evaluated by means of the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). The 90 caregivers reported that 29 patients (32%) had resumed driving and that 11 of the 29 (38%) were subsequently involved in road traffic accidents. During the total duration of our patient population risk exposure, we found 11 cases in our study group, against the 4.7 expected cases calculated in the normal population. The relative risk of road traffic accidents in severe brain injury patients versus uninjured individuals was 2.3. \nCONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data show that a subject who has suffered from severe brain injury and coma lasting for at least 48 hours has a statistically significant higher risk of being involved in a road traffic accident."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[16, 16, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [17, 17, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [18, 18, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury.\"], [38, 38, \"C0683278;T048;706873003\", \"suffering\"], [40, 40, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [41, 41, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [42, 42, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [51, 51, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [52, 52, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [53, 53, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [56, 56, \"C0009421;T047;371632003\", \"coma,\"], [81, 81, \"C0009421;T047;371632003\", \"coma\"], [140, 140, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure,\"], [167, 167, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [168, 168, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [169, 169, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [188, 188, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [189, 189, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [190, 190, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [192, 192, \"C0009421;T047;371632003\", \"coma\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[9, 9, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [10, 10, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [11, 11, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["371632003", "417163006", "706873003", "12738006", "417746004", "258335003", "71677004", "24484000"], "id": "5058d119-5bf5-4f21-881d-17997ffe52a6", "_version_": 1673673951447875588, "score": 59.233692}, {"title": ["Propranolol for severe post-head injury action tremor."], "journal": "Neurology", "journal_id": "0401060", "date": "1978-02-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "564001", "abstract": ["Two children developed persistent, incapacitating, upper extremity tremor following severe head injury from bicycle-automobile collision accidents.

Coping characterized by avoidance, worry, wishful thinking, self-blame, and using drugs and alcohol was associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, and psychosocial dysfunction and lower levels of self-esteem. Coping characterized by actively working on the problem and using humor and enjoyable activities to manage stress was associated with higher self-esteem. Lower premorbid intelligence (measured via the National Adult Reading Test) and greater self-awareness (measured via the Self-Awareness of Deficits Interview) were associated with an increased rate of maladaptive coping. \nCONCLUSIONS: The strong association between the style of coping used to manage stress and emotional adjustment suggests the possibility that emotional adjustment might be improved by the facilitation of more adaptive coping styles. It is also possible that improving emotional adjustment may increase adaptive coping. The development and evaluation of interventions aimed at facilitating adaptive coping and decreasing emotional distress represent important and potentially fruitful contributions to enhancing long-term outcome following brain injury."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[9, 9, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"emotional\"], [12, 14, \"C0876926;T037;127295002\", \"traumatic brain injury.\"], [23, 25, \"C0876926;T037;127295002\", \"traumatic brain injury\"], [29, 30, \"C0002623;T048;275277000\", \"posttraumatic amnesia\"], [48, 48, \"C0003467;T048;48694002\", \"Anxiety\"], [50, 50, \"C0011581;T048;35489007\", \"Depression\"], [55, 58, \"C0683457;T060;304775009\", \"State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory,\"], [61, 63, \"C0242642;T060;273807008\", \"Sickness Impact Profile.\"], [75, 75, \"C0003467;T048;48694002\", \"anxiety\"], [77, 77, \"C0011581;T048;35489007\", \"depression.\"], [82, 82, \"C0233481;T033;79015004\", \"worry,\"], [90, 90, \"C0001975;T109,T121;333164008,53041004\", \"alcohol\"], [97, 98, \"C0338908;T048;231504006\", \"anxiety, depression,\"], [101, 101, \"C0277785;T046;386585008\", \"dysfunction\"], [123, 123, \"C0038435;T033;262188008,73595000\", \"stress\"], [170, 170, \"C0038435;T033;262188008,73595000\", \"stress\"], [172, 172, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"emotional\"], [178, 178, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"emotional\"], [197, 197, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"emotional\"], [215, 215, \"C0442797;T033;260371004\", \"decreasing\"], [216, 216, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"emotional\"], [217, 217, \"C0231303;T033;69328002\", \"distress\"], [229, 229, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [230, 230, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[2, 2, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"emotional\"], [5, 7, \"C0876926;T037;127295002\", \"traumatic brain injury.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["333164008", "258335003", "53041004", "417746004", "73595000", "231504006", "35489007", "127295002", "262188008", "48694002", "275277000", "417163006", "273807008", "260371004", "12738006", "69328002", "408453002", "304775009", "79015004", "386585008"], "id": "c397d295-7305-4f5b-bad1-28c73e0627cf", "_version_": 1673674029560496138, "score": 58.80928}, {"keyword": ["Adaptation", "Glia", "Neurodegeneration", "Preconditioning", "Stress response"], "title": ["Astrocytes Surviving Severe Stress Can Still Protect Neighboring Neurons from Proteotoxic Injury."], "journal": "Mol Neurobiol", "journal_id": "8900963", "date": "2015-09-17T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "26374549", "abstract": ["Astrocytes are one of the major cell types to combat cellular stress and protect neighboring neurons from injury. In order to fulfill this important role, astrocytes must sense and respond to toxic stimuli, perhaps including stimuli that are severely stressful and kill some of the astrocytes. The present study demonstrates that primary astrocytes that managed to survive severe proteotoxic stress were protected against subsequent challenges. These findings suggest that the phenomenon of preconditioning or tolerance can be extended from mild to severe stress for this cell type. Astrocytic stress adaptation lasted at least 96\u00a0h, the longest interval tested. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was raised in stressed astrocytes, but inhibition of neither Hsp70 nor Hsp32 activity abolished their resistance against a second proteotoxic challenge. Only inhibition of glutathione synthesis abolished astrocytic stress adaptation, consistent with our previous report. Primary neurons were plated upon previously stressed astrocytes, and the cocultures were then exposed to another proteotoxic challenge. Severely stressed astrocytes were still able to protect neighboring neurons against this injury, and the protection was unexpectedly independent of glutathione synthesis. Stressed astrocytes were even able to protect neurons after simultaneous application of proteasome and Hsp70 inhibitors, which otherwise elicited synergistic, severe loss of neurons when applied together. Astrocyte-induced neuroprotection against proteotoxicity was not elicited with astrocyte-conditioned media, suggesting that physical cell-to-cell contacts may be essential.

Participants included 19 children with severe TBI, 41 children with complicated mild/moderate TBI, and 57 children with OI. They completed measures of executive function, as well as cognitive, affective, and conative theory of mind. Parents provided ratings of children's social adjustment. Children with severe TBI performed more poorly than children with OI on executive function and theory of mind tasks and were rated by parents as having more behavioral symptoms and worse communication and social skills. Executive function and theory of mind were positively correlated with social skills and communication skills, and negatively correlated with behavioral symptoms. In multiple mediator models, theory of mind and executive function were not significant direct predictors of any measure of social adjustment, but mediated the association between injury and adjustment for children with severe TBI.

This study aimed at clarifying mediation processes between injury severity and mother's, father's, and young child's acute stress. \nMethods: Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships between injury severity and parental and child acute stress. Parents of 138 burn-injured children (ages 1-4 years) completed standardized questionnaires on average 19 days postinjury. \nResults: Sixteen children (11.7%) met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, preschool criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (excluding time criterion). The model revealed a significant mediation of maternal acute stress, with the effect of injury severity on a child's acute stress mediated by maternal acute stress. Paternal acute stress failed to serve as a mediating variable. \nConclusions: Our findings confirm mothers' crucial role in the posttraumatic adjustment of young children. Clinically, mothers' acute stress should be monitored. \n\u00a9 The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Pediatric Psychology. All rights reserved.

Within the TBI group there was differential recovery: improvement in cognitive clarity, dysphoric mood, and emotional stability, but increased difficulties with anger management, antisocial behaviors, and self-monitoring. \nCONCLUSIONS: These results raise questions about commonly held beliefs that those with mild TBI report greater distress, and clarify some misconceptions regarding change in emotional and behavioral functioning over time."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[3, 3, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"emotional\"], [13, 15, \"C0876926;T037;127295002\", \"traumatic brain injury\"], [42, 42, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury.\"], [46, 46, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"trauma\"], [63, 63, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"trauma\"], [68, 68, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [76, 76, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury.\"], [94, 94, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"emotional\"], [109, 109, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [110, 110, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury,\"], [119, 119, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"trauma\"], [138, 138, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [139, 139, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries.\"], [163, 164, \"C0233477;T048;30819006\", \"dysphoric mood,\"], [166, 166, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"emotional\"], [172, 173, \"C0557992;T061;225321003,712558003\", \"anger management,\"], [177, 177, \"C0588436;T061;310858007,441211000124106\", \"self-monitoring.\"], [194, 194, \"C0231303;T033;69328002\", \"distress,\"], [202, 202, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"emotional\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C0849912;T033;408453002\", \"Emotional\"], [5, 7, \"C0876926;T037;127295002\", \"traumatic brain injury.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["225321003", "441211000124106", "417163006", "30819006", "258335003", "69328002", "712558003", "24484000", "408453002", "417746004", "12738006", "310858007", "127295002"], "id": "a41b1428-29e1-4ba1-9ec2-0a04b8684ef8", "_version_": 1673673630826889225, "score": 58.34516}, {"title": ["[Traffic accidents associated with emotional stress after divorce]."], "journal": "Fa Yi Xue Za Zhi", "journal_id": "9426151", "date": "2009-06-20T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "19537257", "abstract": ["In recent years, the traffic accidents increased gradually, especially those caused by the drivers daily emotional abnormality and in which the drivers were liable.

Acute stress disorder, a new diagnosis intended to facilitate early case detection, rests on the occurrence of dissociative reactions. It remains uncertain whether dissociation is a universal or unique early predictor of subsequent PTSD. Traumatic injury is an important and relatively understudied antecedent of PTSD. The objective of this study was to preliminarily identify which previously implicated early reactions and risk factors would apply to the prediction of PTSD following severe traumatic injury. Patients admitted to a regional Level I trauma center following life threatening events who had recall of the incident and did not have signs of traumatic brain injury or recent psychopathology were enrolled. Comprehensive assessments were conducted during hospitalization and after discharge approximately 2 months after the traumatic event. At follow-up, 24% of the available 50 subjects met full criteria for PTSD and an additional 22% met criteria for two of three symptom clusters.

However, there was evidence of an increased risk of more severe accidents in the population with epilepsy. The risk was increased by about 40% for serious injuries and there was evidence of a twofold risk of increase in non-driver fatalities. These increases seem largely explicable by the occurrence of seizures in this population during the three years of driving that the survey covered. \nCONCLUSIONS: The acceptability of driving for people with a history of epilepsy should be determined by an acceptable risk of accidents resulting in injury or serious injury rather than overall accident rates.

Children responded to scenarios involving negative social situations by selecting from a fixed set of choices their causal attribution for the event, their emotional reaction to the event and how they would behave in response. Parent ratings of social behaviours and classmate friendship nominations and sociometric ratings were obtained for a sub-set of all participants. \nRESULTS: Children with severe TBI were less likely than children with OI to indicate they would attribute external blame or respond by avoiding the antagonist; they were more likely to indicate they would feel sad and request adult intervention.

The same number of control were selected. Both cases and controls were tested to reaction time. \nRESULTS: We found statistically significant difference between car drivers who caused car accidents and those who did not in both simple and choice reaction times. \nDISCUSSION: Car drivers who caused road traffic accidents have longer reaction time (both simple and choice reaction time), but as the tasks were more complex, that difference was less visible. Since drivers involved in this study had introductory phase before measuring their reaction times, they faced with unpleasant sound when they made mistake, which forced them to be aware not to make a mistake in further tasks, so they showed longer reaction times. \nCONCLUSION: Measuring of reaction time seems to be important, and as we have showed they are different in drivers who have caused road traffic accidents and those who have do not."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[10, 10, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [75, 75, \"C0001975;T109,T121;333164008,53041004\", \"alcohol\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[]", "snomed_codes": ["417746004", "53041004", "333164008"], "id": "626ea151-d911-4204-9a45-82b09d09337d", "_version_": 1673674251271405589, "score": 57.47828}, {"title": ["Featured Article: Interpersonal Stressors and Resources as Predictors of Adolescent Adjustment Following Traumatic Brain Injury."], "journal": "J Pediatr Psychol", "journal_id": "7801773", "date": "2018-04-05T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "29617953", "abstract": ["Objective: The present study sought to examine adolescents' perceptions of their interpersonal stressors and resources across parent, sibling, friend, and school relationships, and the longitudinal associations with self-reported adjustment after traumatic brain injury (TBI) over a 12-month period. \nMethods: We examined the main effects of stressors and resources on internalizing and externalizing symptoms in 152 adolescents who had sustained complicated mild-to-severe TBI. We also investigated the conjoint effects of stressors and resources and the moderating effects of TBI severity with stressors and resources on outcomes. \nResults: High stressors consistently predicted worse adjustment. High resources were generally only associated with fewer internalizing symptoms. Main effects were qualified by interactions between school stressors and resources in predicting externalizing symptoms and between friend stressors and resources in predicting internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For school stressors, the effects of resources on externalizing symptoms functioned as a buffer. In comparison, the buffering effects of friend resources on internalizing and externalizing symptoms disappeared at moderate-to-high levels of friend stress. Moderating effects of TBI severity were also observed, such that as family resources increased, only adolescents with complicated mild-to-moderate TBI, but not those with severe TBI, experienced decreases in internalizing and eternalizing symptoms. \nConclusion: Interpersonal stressors and social support have important implications for adolescent adjustment after TBI.

We study the effect of a number of factors including traffic information, road conditions, type of accidents, speed limits, presence of intelligent traffic control systems, age and gender of the driver and location of the accident. Our findings are in line with studies in different settings and indicate that accidents during daylight and at interchanges or construction sites are less severe in general. Accidents caused by the collision with roadside objects, involving pedestrians and motorcycles, or caused by bad sight conditions tend to be more severe. We discuss the measures of the 2011 German traffic safety programm in the light of our results. \nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, research has been primarily focused on high-risk workers, such as police officers or firefighters, and has rarely considered individuals whose occupational environment involves the risk of severe, but not necessarily life-threatening, injury. Therefore, the present study was aimed at assessing the psychological consequences of accidents occurring in several occupational settings (e.g., construction and industry). Thirty-eight victims of occupational accidents (injured workers) and 38 gender-, age-, and years of education-matched workers who never experienced a work accident (control group) were recruited. All participants underwent a semi-structured interview administered by a trained psychologist, and then were requested to fill in the questionnaires. Injured workers reported more severe anxious, post-traumatic and depressive symptoms, and poorer coping skills, as compared to controls. In the injured group low levels of resilience predicted post-traumatic symptomatology, whereas the degree of physical injury and the length of time since the accident did not play a predictive role.

The work covers technical aspects of severe accidents and thus primarily reflects an engineering perspective on the energy-related risk issues, though some social implications are also touched upon. The assessment concerns fossil energy sources (coal, oil and gas), nuclear power and hydro power. The scope is not limited to the power production (conversion) step of these energy chains but, whenever applicable, also includes exploration, extraction, transports, processing, storage and waste disposal. With the exception of the nuclear chain the focus of the work has been on the evaluation of the historical experience of accidents. The basis used for this evaluation is a comprehensive database ENSAD (Energy-related Severe Accident Database), established by the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). For hypothetical nuclear accidents the probabilistic technique has also been employed and extended to cover the assessment of economic consequences of such accidents. The broader picture obtained by coverage of full energy chains leads on the world-wide basis to aggregated immediate fatality rates being much higher for the fossil chains than what one would expect if only power plants were considered. Generally, the immediate fatality rates are for all considered energy carriers significantly higher for the non-OECD countries than for OECD countries. In the case of hydro and nuclear the difference is in fact dramatic. The presentation of results is not limited to the aggregated values specific for each energy chain. Also frequency-consequence curves are provided. They reflect implicitly the ranking based on the aggregated values but include also such information as the observed or predicted chain-specific maximum extents of damages.

Among these patients, 53 patients declared being litigants and 78 nonlitigants (litigation status was unknown in 16 cases). Sociodemographic characteristics, type of injury and initial severity did not differ significantly between litigants and nonlitigants, except for Injury Severity Score (worse in litigants) and the proportion of road traffic accidents (higher in litigants). One- and four-year outcomes were significantly worse in litigants for autonomy, participation, psychiatric and cognitive function but not quality of life (measured with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, the working activity status, the Brain Injury Community Rehabilitation Outcome, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale-revised and the Quality of Life after Brain Injury, respectively). Multivariate analyses highlighted litigation procedure as an independent significant predictor of lower autonomy, participation and psychiatric function and tended to predict lower cognitive function, but not lower quality of life, after adjustment for pretrauma characteristics, Injury Severity Score, road traffic accidents and work-related accident status. \nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe traumatic brain injury have a worse prognosis when involved in a litigation procedure and require special attention in clinical practice. Implications for rehabilitation The influence of litigation procedure on health and social outcomes in severe traumatic brain injury is a major issue that entail numerous levels of complexities. A wide range of interactions and factors related to the prolonged process of litigation against a third party may influence recovery. Results from the PariS-Traumatic Brain Injury study suggest that patients with a severe Traumatic Brain Injury who are involved in a litigation procedure within French jurisdiction compensation scheme have a worse prognosis than patients who do not.

Age and gender distribution, education, occupation, location of trauma, mechanism of injury, alcohol use, type and severity of injury, associated injuries, length of intensive care unit stay, and intensive care unit outcome were evaluated for each of the 5 centers. \nRESULTS: The sample represents roughly 13% of all cases with severe TBI which were treated in Austrian hospitals during the study period. Mean age was 48 +/- 21 years, and most patients were male (72%). The most important trauma locations were roads (50%), home (24%), outdoors (10%), and workplace (7%). Transportrelated trauma was the most important mechanism (44%) followed by falls < 3 m (30%), falls > 3 m (11%), and sports injuries (5%). Detailed analysis of transport-related trauma showed that car accidents (45%) were most common, followed by pedestrian (20%), motorbike (19%), and bicycle (16%) accidents. Significant differences between the centers were found for most of the variables analyzed. The severe traumatic brain injury was associated with spinal cord injury in 10%, and with severe multiple trauma in 38% of cases. Intensive care mortality was 31.7%.

Our study revealed 22 cases of severe accidents due to windsurfing, with a wide range of injuries including head injuries, spinal cord injuries, and severe fractures of the extremities. Prolonged hospitalization, severe disability and two deaths occurred as consequences of these accidents. The study examined the characteristics of these patients and the possible risk factors and conditions associated with the accidents.

One important measure of accident severity is the most severely injured occupant in the vehicle. Such data are routinely collected in state accident data files in the U.S. Among the many risk factors that determine the most severe level of injury sustained by vehicle occupants, the number of occupants in the vehicle is an important factor. These effects can be significant because vehicles with higher occupancies have an increased likelihood of having someone seriously injured. This paper studies the occupancy/injury severity relationship using Washington State accident data. The effects of large trucks, which are shown to have a significant impact on the most severely injured vehicle occupant, are accounted for by separately estimating nested logit models for truck-involved accidents and for non-truck-involved accidents. The estimation results uncover important relationships between various risk factors and occupant injury. In addition, by comparing the accident characteristics between truck-involved accidents and non-truck-involved accidents, the risk factors unique to large trucks are identified along with the relative importance of such factors. The findings of this study demonstrate that nested logit modeling, which is able to take into account vehicle occupancy effects and identify a broad range of factors that influence occupant injury, is a promising methodological approach."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[28, 28, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severely\"], [33, 33, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle.\"], [56, 56, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [59, 59, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [62, 62, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"], [70, 70, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"], [122, 122, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severely\"], [124, 124, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"], [154, 154, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury.\"], [202, 202, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"], [215, 215, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury,\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[2, 2, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [5, 5, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["417746004", "412307009", "417163006", "24484000", "96005000"], "id": "d2181422-3f85-47d9-9a25-b9587f8c6b7c", "_version_": 1673673633421066251, "score": 56.756706}, {"title": ["Prevention of intraoperative anesthesia accidents and related severe injury through safety monitoring."], "journal": "Anesthesiology", "journal_id": "1300217", "date": "1989-04-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "2929993", "abstract": ["Among 1,001,000 ASA Physical Status I and II patients (a subset of the 1,329,000 anesthetics administered from 1976 through mid-1988 in the nine component hospitals of the Harvard Department of Anaesthesia), there were 11 major intraoperative accidents solely attributable to anesthesia (five deaths, four cases of permanent CNS damage, and two cardiac arrests with eventual recovery) among the 70 cases reported to the insurance carrier. Review of these accidents revealed that unrecognized hypoventilation was the most common cause (seven cases). These seven accidents and one other due to discontinuation of inspired oxygen in all likelihood would have been prevented by appropriate response to earlier warnings generated by the \"safety monitoring\" principles mandated by the Harvard minimal monitoring standards. Analysis suggests capnography (although not mandated) would be the best monitor of ventilation. An important associated issue was the apparent inadequacy of supervision of residents and C.R.N.A.s. The eight preventable accidents represent 88% of the projected insurance payout. Only one accident occurred after the 1985 adoption of the standards (in the month following their implementation). From that time through mid-1988, there have been 319,000 anesthetics without a major preventable intraoperative injury. Although not statistically significant, the accident rate in the target population of healthy people is reduced more than threefold.

Whereas characterization of injury patterns following motor vehicle accidents has led to safety initiatives and treatment guidelines, knowledge related to bicyclist injuries is lacking. Our purpose is to identify major injury patterns and outcomes associated with pediatric bicycle accidents. \nMETHODS: From January 2000 to December 2012, 1934 consecutive pediatric admissions (\u226417 years) at a level I trauma center were retrospectively reviewed for mechanism injury, demographics, and outcomes. Parametric data were analyzed with student's t test and are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Nonparametric data were analyzed with Mann-Whitney-U test and are presented as median (interquartile range). Analysis was performed to recognize injury patterns and outcomes significantly associated with bicycle related accidents. \nRESULTS: 80 pediatric patients were admitted following bicycle related trauma (4% of all pediatric trauma admissions). The cohort was age 11 \u00b1 4 years, ISS 11 \u00b1 10, 48% black, and 81% male. Injury patterns included 21% isolated head, 21% isolated abdominal, 13% isolated extremity, and 34% multiple injuries. 5% were age 0-4 years, 35% were age 5-9 years, 45% were 10-14 years, and 15% were 15-17 years (p < 0.001). 16% required operative intervention (6% abdominal, 9% orthopedic, 1% vascular).

The total poisoning rate was 54.8%, and the total mortality was 16.5%. The average poisoning age was (31.9 +/- 9.8) years old and the average death age was (33.7 +/- 10.3) years old. The poisoning accidents occurred more in men than in women. (2) There were more than 112 chemicals which caused these poisoning accidents. Most of the accidents caused by hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, benzene and homologs, metal and metalloid and carbon dioxide, and the types of chemicals varied in different types of industries. (3) The accidents mainly occurred in chemical industry, manufacture, water disposal industry, mining and construction industry, and the risk was higher in some jobs than others, such as cleanout, machine maintenance and repair, production, mine and digging. The accidents occurred more frequently from April to August each year. \nCONCLUSION: (1) The control over the severe acute occupational poisoning is urgent.

In older adults it is often associated with falls. Severe head injury can lead to secondary brain damage from cerebral ischaemia resulting from hypotension, hypercapnia, and raised intracranial pressure. Severity of brain injury is assessed using the GCS. While about a quarter of people with severe brain injury (GCS score less than 8) will make a good recovery, about a third will die, and a fifth will have severe disability or be in a vegetative state. \nMETHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of interventions to reduce complications of moderate to severe head injury as defined by Glasgow Coma Scale? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to April 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). \nRESULTS: We found 17 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. \nCONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, hyperventilation, hypothermia, and mannitol."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[1, 2, \"C0018674;T037;82271004\", \"Head injury\"], [11, 11, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"], [16, 16, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries.\"], [25, 25, \"C0085639;T033;161898004,1912002\", \"falls.\"], [26, 26, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"Severe\"], [27, 28, \"C0018674;T037;82271004\", \"head injury\"], [33, 34, \"C1456496;T037;127294003\", \"brain damage\"], [36, 37, \"C0917798;T046;287731003\", \"cerebral ischaemia\"], [40, 40, \"C0020649;T033;45007003\", \"hypotension,\"], [41, 41, \"C0020440;T033;29596007\", \"hypercapnia,\"], [43, 45, \"C0151740;T033;271719001\", \"raised intracranial pressure.\"], [48, 48, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [49, 49, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [62, 62, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [63, 63, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [64, 64, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [85, 85, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [86, 86, \"C0231170;T033;21134002\", \"disability\"], [121, 121, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [122, 123, \"C0018674;T037;82271004\", \"head injury\"], [128, 128, \"C0009421;T047;371632003\", \"Coma\"], [176, 177, \"C0150270;T058;182832007.C3469597;T061;18629005\", \"Drug Administration\"], [224, 224, \"C0001617;T125,T109,T121;21568003,79440004\", \"corticosteroids,\"], [225, 225, \"C0020578;T033;68978004\", \"hyperventilation,\"], [226, 226, \"C0020672;T033;386689009\", \"hypothermia,\"], [228, 228, \"C0024730;T109,T121;30761007,387168006\", \"mannitol.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 1, \"C0018674;T037;82271004\", \"Head injury\"], [4, 4, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe).\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["82271004", "30761007", "387168006", "127294003", "12738006", "182832007", "417746004", "1912002", "68978004", "21134002", "18629005", "412307009", "79440004", "29596007", "271719001", "258335003", "45007003", "24484000", "161898004", "21568003", "386689009", "96005000", "371632003", "287731003", "417163006"], "id": "fbfbdcd1-da6a-49d6-bc9a-ecbffc5281ff", "_version_": 1673674232213536771, "score": 56.276936}, {"keyword": ["Horse", "Horse riding", "Multiple trauma", "Rider", "Trauma mechanism"], "title": ["[Accidents in equestrian sports : Analysis of injury mechanisms and patterns]."], "journal": "Unfallchirurg", "journal_id": "8502736", "date": "2015-10-10T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "26449915", "abstract": ["BACKGROUND: Equestrian sports are one of the most popular forms of sport in Germany, while also being one of the most accident-prone sports. Furthermore, riding accidents are frequently associated with a high degree of severity of injuries and mortality. Nevertheless, there are insufficient data regarding incidences, demographics, mechanisms of accidents, injury severity and patterns and outcome of injured persons in amateur equestrian sports. Accordingly, it was the aim of the present study to retrospectively analyze these aspects. \nMETHODS: A total of 503 patients were treated in the emergency room of the Hannover Medical School because of an accident during recreational horse riding between 2006 and 2011. The female gender was predominantly affected with 89.5\u2009%. The mean age of the patients was 26.2\u2009\u00b1\u200914.9 years and women (24.5\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5 years) were on average younger than men (40.2\u2009\u00b1\u200923.9 years). A special risk group was girls and young women aged between 10 and 39 years. The overall injury severity was measured using the injury severity score (ISS). \nRESULTS: Based on the total population, head injuries were the most common location of injuries with 17.3\u2009% followed by injuries to the upper extremities with 15.2\u2009% and the thoracic and lumbar spine with 10.9\u2009%. The three most common injury locations after falling from a horse were the head (17.5\u2009%), the upper extremities (17.4\u2009%), the thoracic and lumbar spine (12.9\u2009%). The most frequent injuries while handling horses were foot injuries (17.2\u2009%), followed by head (16.6\u2009%) and mid-facial injuries (15.0\u2009%). With respect to the mechanism of injury accidents while riding were predominant (74\u2009%), while accidents when handling horses accounted for only 26\u2009%. The median ISS was 9.8 points. The proportion of multiple trauma patients (ISS >\u200916) was 18.1\u2009%. Based on the total sample, the average in-hospital patient stay was 5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4 days with a significantly higher proportion of hospitalized patients in the group of riding accidents. Fatal cases were not found in this study but the danger of riding is not to be underestimated. The large number of sometimes severe injuries with ISS values up to 62 points can be interpreted as an indication that recreational riding can easily result in life-threatening situations. \nCONCLUSION: Girls and young women could be identified as a group at particular risk. It has been demonstrated in this study that the three most common injury locations after falling from a horse were the head, the upper extremities, the thoracic and lumbar spine. The most frequent injury locations while handling horses were foot injuries, followed by head and mid-facial injuries."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[36, 36, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [50, 50, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [152, 152, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [158, 158, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [168, 168, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [169, 169, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [176, 176, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [181, 181, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [190, 190, \"C0817096;T029;261179002,51185008\", \"thoracic\"], [192, 193, \"C3887615;T029;122496007.C1284112;T023;361686005.C0024091;T023;73903008\", \"lumbar spine\"], [200, 200, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [209, 209, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [216, 216, \"C0817096;T029;261179002,51185008\", \"thoracic\"], [218, 219, \"C3887615;T029;122496007.C1284112;T023;361686005.C0024091;T023;73903008\", \"lumbar spine\"], [224, 224, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [229, 229, \"C1281587;T023;302545001.C0016504;T023;56459004\", \"foot\"], [230, 230, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [234, 234, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [238, 238, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [246, 246, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [271, 272, \"C0026771;T037;57028002,262519004,12835000\", \"multiple trauma\"], [308, 309, \"C0442737;T033;260415000\", \"not found\"], [328, 328, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severe\"], [329, 329, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries\"], [347, 347, \"C0332219;T033;36203004\", \"easily\"], [378, 378, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [387, 387, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head,\"], [392, 392, \"C0817096;T029;261179002,51185008\", \"thoracic\"], [394, 395, \"C3887615;T029;122496007.C1284112;T023;361686005.C0024091;T023;73903008\", \"lumbar spine.\"], [399, 399, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"], [405, 405, \"C1281587;T023;302545001.C0016504;T023;56459004\", \"foot\"], [406, 406, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries,\"], [409, 409, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [412, 412, \"C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injuries.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[7, 7, \"C3263722;T037;417163006.C3263723;T037;417746004\", \"injury\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["56459004", "417163006", "73903008", "12835000", "24484000", "69536005", "260415000", "51185008", "57028002", "122496007", "36203004", "261179002", "361686005", "302545001", "417746004", "262519004", "302548004"], "id": "7ff93300-6604-4a34-8086-be18de3c5635", "_version_": 1673674961715200001, "score": 56.168003}, {"title": ["Nervous system injuries in horseback-riding accidents."], "journal": "J Trauma", "journal_id": "0376373", "date": "1993-02-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "8459460", "abstract": ["A review of 156 horseback-riding accidents that occurred in southern Alberta over a 6-year period and resulted in nervous system trauma, including 11 deaths, is presented.

Therefore, we report the severity and pattern of injury in 97 survivors of a major fall in Alpine terrain. Twenty-eight of 97 victims (29%) had severe or critical multisystem trauma, with an injury severity score >/=14, the incidence increasing to 23 out of 28 (82%) in individuals with falls exceeding 50 m. Fractures of the extremities and the sacropelvic region (n = 55) were the most common injuries. Seventeen of 21 spine fractures (81%) occurred in the thoracolumbar region. Rib fractures were found in 17 victims, in eight of them (47%) with an accompanying pneumothorax. Critical head trauma with a Glasgow Come Scale below 9 was rather uncommon (n = 6); abdominal visceral injuries were rare (n = 2). The pattern of injury observed in our study suggests a feet- or side-first body position at impact in the majority of individuals surviving Alpine fall accidents.

Guilt is a common reaction among children after a traumatic event and has been shown to contribute to posttraumatic stress disorder. However, its relationship to ASD has never been examined. \nOBJECTIVE: This study assessed the prevalence of ASD in children and adolescents following road traffic accidents (RTAs). Moreover, the association between peritraumatic guilt and ASD was investigated relying on current cognitive theories of posttraumatic stress and controlling for female sex, age, socioeconomic status (SES), injury severity, inpatient treatment, pretrauma psychopathology, and maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). \nMETHODS: One hundred and one children and adolescents (aged 7-16 years) were assessed by means of a clinical interview approximately 10 days after an RTA. Mothers were assessed by questionnaires. \nRESULTS: Three participants (3.0%) met diagnostic criteria for full ASD according to DSM-IV, and 17 (16.8%) for subsyndromal ASD. In a multivariate regression model, guilt was found to be a significant predictor of ASD severity. Female sex, outpatient treatment, and maternal PTSS also predicted ASD severity. Child age, SES, injury severity, and pretraumatic child psychopathology were not related to ASD severity. \nCONCLUSIONS: Future research should examine the association between peritraumatic guilt and acute stress symptoms in more detail.

However, when appraisal and coping variables were combined with psychosocial variables as direct predictors of outcome, every outcome except employment status was reliably predicted, accounting for between 31 and 46% of the variance.

Further analysis illustrated that the presence of illumination does not reduce the severity of accidents for high-speed trains. In addition, there is a greater propensity toward fatal accidents for elderly road users compared to younger individuals. Interestingly, at night, injury accidents involving female road users are more severe compared to those involving males. \nCONCLUSIONS: The ordered probit model was the primary technique, and CART and association rules act as the supporter and identifier of interactions between variables.

Over the first 4 years post-injury, 17.6% developed injury-related PTSD, none of whom had PTSD prior to injury. PTSD onset peaked between 6 and 12 months post-injury. The majority of PTSD cases (66.7%) had a delayed-onset, which for a third was preceded by subsyndromal symptoms in the first 6 months post-injury. PTSD frequency increased over the first year post-injury, remained stable during the second year, and gradually declined thereafter.
