Puff topography and plasma nicotine were measured. Three waterpipe tobacco brands were used: Nakhla (0.5% nicotine), Starbuzz (0.05% nicotine), and Al Fakher (0.05% nicotine). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. \nRESULTS: Topography did not differ across brands. Peak plasma nicotine varied significantly across brands. Al Fakher had the highest nicotine delivery (11.4 ng/ml) followed by Nakhla (9.8 ng/ml) and Starbuzz (5.8 ng/ml). \nCONCLUSIONS: Nicotine labelling on waterpipe tobacco products does not reflect delivery; smoking a brand with a \"0.05% nicotine\" label led to greater plasma nicotine levels than smoking a brand with a \"0.5% nicotine\" label.

Smokers present with more severe and extended chronic pain outcomes and have a higher frequency of prescription opioid use. Current tobacco smoking is a strong predictor of risk for nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Opioid and nicotinic-cholinergic neurotransmitter systems interact in important ways to modulate opioid and nicotine effects: dopamine release induced by nicotine is dependent on facilitation by the opioid system, and the nicotinic-acetylcholine system modulates self-administration of several classes of abused drugs-including opioids. Nicotine can serve as a prime for the use of other drugs, which\u00a0in the case of the opioid system may be bidirectional.\u00a0Opioids and compounds in tobacco, including nicotine, are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, but the metabolism of opioids and tobacco products can be complicated. Accordingly, drug interactions are possible but not always clear. Because of these issues, asking about nicotine use in patients taking opioids for pain is recommended. When assessing patient tobacco use, practitioners should also obtain information on products other than cigarettes, such as cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco, and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS, or e-cigarettes).

There is no report in the literature on nicotine level of Ethiopian raw (unprocessed) tobacco leaves. Hence, the objective of this study is to determine the levels of nicotine in the Ethiopian tobacco leaves. Samples were collected based on their leaves positions, species and place of cultivation from different regions of Ethiopia. These were Virginia type tobacco from Shewa Robit and Billate, Burley and Oriental types of tobacco from Awassa and native tobacco used as pipe smoking (Gaya) from Wollayita. The level of nicotine in four different varieties of Ethiopian tobacco leaves was determined using high performance liquid chromatography. The level of nicotine in the four different varieties of Ethiopian tobacco were Virginia tobacco (3.26\u00a0%), the native tobacco 'Gaya' (1.10\u00a0%), Burley tobacco (0.650\u00a0%), and Oriental tobacco leaves (\u22640.0500\u00a0%). It was found that the nicotine level of Ethiopian Virginia tobacco leaves increases from bottom to top leaf (stalk) positions of the tobacco plant.

A rapid and effective enantiomeric separation of nicotine has been developed using a modified macrocyclic glycopeptide bonded to superficially porous particles. The enantiomeric assay can be completed in <2\u00a0min with high resolution and accuracy using high performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The results of this study suggest the need for pharmacological studies of (R)-(+)-nicotine, which is present in much greater quantities in commercial TFN products compared to commercial tobacco-derived products. Such studies are required by the FDA for new enantiomeric pharmacological products.

Smokeless tobacco contains the addictive chemical nicotine and more than 20 cancer-causing chemicals, including the potent tobacco-specific nitrosamines. The National Toxicology Program of the National Institutes of Health has concluded that oral use of smokeless tobacco is a human carcinogen. Therefore, smokeless tobacco is not a safe alternative to cigarettes. In fact, smokeless tobacco use begins primarily during early adolescence and can lead to nicotine dependence and increased risk of becoming a cigarette smoker. Under the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 4401 et seq., Pub. L. 99-252), tobacco manufacturers report annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the total nicotine, unprotonated nicotine, pH, and moisture content of their smokeless tobacco products. This information is considered \"trade secret,\" or confidential, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and 18 U.S.C. 1905 and cannot be released to the public. In an effort to provide consumers and researchers with information on the nicotine content of smokeless tobacco, CDC arranged for the analysis of popular brands of smokeless tobacco. The results of this CDC study show that pH is a primary factor in the amount of nicotine that is in the most readily absorbable, unprotonated form.

Search terms included low-, no-, reduced-nicotine; denicotinization; low-, reduced- alkaloids; Next; de-nic; and key names of people, organisations, projects, and their common abbreviations and acronyms. \nRESULTS: The tobacco industry has made repeated efforts to develop low nicotine cigarettes. Reasons for doing so include consumer appeal and economic importance in a highly competitive cigarette market for \"healthier\" products. The industry considered the development of a new \"denic\" market segment a critical challenge. \nCONCLUSIONS: The tobacco industry exploits consumer misunderstanding of the health effects of nicotine in development and marketing efforts.

The aim of this study was to determine typical pH ranges and concentrations of total nicotine, unionised nicotine (the most readily absorbed form) and five TSNAs in selected oral tobacco products distributed globally. \nMETHODS: A total of 53 oral tobacco products from 5 World Health Organisation (WHO) regions were analysed for total nicotine and TSNAs, including 4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), using gas chromatography or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. Unionised nicotine concentrations were calculated using product pH and total nicotine concentrations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to help categorize or characterise some products. \nRESULTS: Total nicotine content varied from 0.16 to 34.1 mg/g product, whereas, the calculated unionised nicotine ranged from 0.05 to 31.0 mg/g product; a 620-fold range of variation. Products ranged from pH 5.2 to 10.1, which translates to 0.2% to 99.1% of nicotine being in the unionised form. Some products have very high pH and correspondingly high unionised nicotine (eg, gul powder, chim\u00f3, toombak) and/or high TSNA (eg, toombak, zarda, khaini) concentrations. The concentrations of TSNAs spanned five orders of magnitude with concentrations of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) ranging from 4.5 to 516,000 ng/g product. \nCONCLUSIONS: These data have important implications for risk assessment because they show that very different exposure risks may be posed through the use of these chemically diverse oral tobacco products.

Among the seven product categories, product pH ranged from 4.7 to 7.9, and total nicotine concentration spanned from 3.9 to 40.1 mg/g. The most readily absorbable form of nicotine (unprotonated nicotine) varied more than 350-fold, ranging from 0.01 to 3.7 mg/g. While the highest total nicotine concentrations were observed in twist products, snus and dissolvable tobacco had the highest unprotonated nicotine levels.

The objective of this study was to determine nicotine absorption for current pouched and loose snus products in comparison with a cigarette and an over-the-counter nicotine gum. \nMETHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized, 6-way, crossover study involving 20 healthy snus and cigarette users. One of 6 products (2 pouched snus, 2 weights of loose snus, a cigarette, and a nicotine gum) was administered at each of 6 visits. Blood samples were taken at intervals over 120 min and sensory perception assessed by questionnaire. \nRESULTS: For the 4 smokeless tobacco products and the nicotine gum, blood plasma levels of nicotine were ranked according to total nicotine content as follows: loose snus (27.1 mg nicotine) > pouched snus (14.7 mg nicotine) > loose snus (10.8 mg nicotine) = pouched snus (10.7 mg nicotine) > nicotine gum (4.2 mg nicotine). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of nicotine ranged from 26.9 to 13.1 ng.h/ml and 17.9 to 9.1 ng.h/ml, respectively across all the products. Nicotine was absorbed more rapidly from the cigarette but systemic exposure was within the range of the smokeless tobacco products (AUC = 14.8 ng.h/ml; C(max) = 12.8 ng.h/ml). \nCONCLUSIONS: This study has generated new information on comparative nicotine absorption from a cigarette, loose snus, and pouched snus typical of products sold in Scandinavia. The similar nicotine absorption for 1 g portions of loose and pouched snus with approximately 11 mg of nicotine indicate that absorption kinetics were dependent on quantity of tobacco by weight and total nicotine content rather than product form."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[5, 5, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [26, 26, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [43, 43, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [44, 44, \"C1378701;T122;426210003.C0017562;T024;113279002\", \"gum.\"], [77, 77, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [78, 78, \"C1378701;T122;426210003.C0017562;T024;113279002\", \"gum)\"], [86, 86, \"C0005767;T031;87612001\", \"Blood\"], [106, 106, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [110, 110, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [111, 111, \"C1378701;T122;426210003.C0017562;T024;113279002\", \"gum,\"], [112, 113, \"C0032105;T031;419185008,50863008\", \"blood plasma\"], [116, 116, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [122, 122, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [130, 130, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine)\"], [136, 136, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine)\"], [142, 142, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine)\"], [148, 148, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine)\"], [150, 150, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [151, 151, \"C1378701;T122;426210003.C0017562;T024;113279002\", \"gum\"], [154, 154, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine).\"], [159, 159, \"C0032105;T031;419185008,50863008\", \"plasma\"], [165, 165, \"C0032105;T031;419185008,50863008\", \"plasma\"], [169, 169, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [186, 186, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [196, 196, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [204, 204, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [223, 223, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [241, 241, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [257, 257, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [267, 267, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [272, 272, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[2, 2, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [6, 6, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [9, 9, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [10, 10, \"C1378701;T122;426210003.C0017562;T024;113279002\", \"gum.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["50863008", "87612001", "426210003", "113279002", "68540007", "71677004", "323283001", "39953003", "419185008"], "id": "0441f068-4bcc-46eb-a072-35adf2881f65", "_version_": 1673674517654798351}, {"keyword": ["(R)-nicotine", "Enantioselectivity", "Nicotiana tabacum L.", "Nicotine demethylase", "Nornicotine", "Solanaceae", "Tobacco"], "title": ["(R)-nicotine biosynthesis, metabolism and translocation in tobacco as determined by nicotine demethylase mutants."], "journal": "Phytochemistry", "journal_id": "0151434", "date": "2013-07-16T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "23849545", "abstract": ["Nicotine is a chiral compound and consequently exists as two enantiomers. Since (R)-nicotine consists of less than 0.5% of total nicotine pool in tobacco, few investigations relating to (R)-nicotine have been reported. However, previous studies of nicotine demethylases suggested there was substantial amount of (R)-nicotine at synthesis in the tobacco plant. In this study, the accumulation and translocation of (R)-nicotine in tobacco was analyzed. The accumulation of nicotine and its demethylation product the nornicotine enantiomers, were investigated in different tobacco plant parts and at different growth and post-harvest stages. Scion/rootstock grafts were used to separate the contributions of roots (source) from leaves (sink) to the final accumulation of nicotine and nornicotine in leaf tissue. The results indicate that 4% of nicotine is in the (R) form at synthesis in the root. After the majority of (R)-nicotine is selectively demethylated by CYP82E4, CYP82E5v2 and CYP82E10 in the root, nicotine and nornicotine are translocated to leaf, where more nicotine becomes demethylated. Depending on the CYP82E4 activity in senescing leaf, constant low (R)-nicotine remains in the tobacco leaf and variable nornicotine composition is produced. These results confirmed the enantioselectivity of three nicotine demethylases in planta, could be used to predict the changes of nicotine and nornicotine composition, and may facilitate demethylase discovery in the future.  \nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Under the conditions used in these studies, the peak transfer temperatures of these substances to nicotine in the gas phase are nicotine and nicotine acetate, both ca. 110-125 degrees C; nicotine malates, ca. 110-210 degrees C for nicotine to malic acid ratios of 1:0.56 and 1:1 and ca. 160-210 degrees C for a nicotine to malic acid ratio of 1:2; (S)-nicotine bis[(2R,3R)-hydrogen tartrate] dihydrate, ca. 195-210 degrees C; and tobacco samples, a range of ca. 160-220 degrees C.

In all cases, the temperature of the transfer of nicotine to the gas phase was found to be many hundreds of degrees below the temperatures observed around the coal of a burning cigarette (smolder, ca. 500-775 degrees C; dynamic smoking, 600 to over 950 degrees C).

Four principal areas of interest are evident. First, research on tobacco products was directed towards greater understanding of nicotine pharmacology, how to screen for potential analogues and how to separate the central and peripheral effects of nicotine. Secondly, interest lay in the potential for analogues to replace nicotine in order to create more 'desirable' products and to circumvent anticipated nicotine regulation. Thirdly, interest lay in potential pharmaceutical applications for analogues such as treatments for neurological disorders. Finally, there was interest in the public relations potential of the therapeutic potential of analogues to reduce the demonization of nicotine, by allowing the industry to point to its beneficial uses. \nCONCLUSIONS: With tobacco product and nicotine regulation being increasingly advocated in tobacco control it is important to understand the industry's interests in the potential role of nicotine analogues. Initial interest included using analogues as a means to circumvent regulation, but evidence suggests these plans were discarded due to fear that this may have instigated regulation of tobacco products. Nicotine analogue research has led to potential therapeutic uses for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and alarmingly for the industry, to a potential vaccine to prevent nicotine addiction. \nRECOMMENDATIONS: Tobacco manufacturers should be obliged to declare all additives being used in tobacco products.

Most toxicity due to cigarette smoking is related to the burning process. \nAPPROACH: Models of harm reduction applied to tobacco suggest that use of non-combustible, less toxic, nicotine-containing products as a substitute for cigarette smoking would reduce the death toll arising from tobacco use. Available options include medicinal nicotine and smokeless tobacco products. \nKEY FINDINGS: The potential role of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products in a harm reduction strategy is currently severely restricted by strict regulations on dose, safety and potential addictiveness. As a result, NRT products are designed to provide much less nicotine, and deliver it to the brain more slowly, than cigarettes, which are widely accessible and poorly regulated. Smokeless tobacco (snus) has proved to be an acceptable reduced hazard alternative to smoking in Sweden, but supply of snus is illegal elsewhere in the European Union. \nIMPLICATIONS: To increase accessibility and reach more smokers, barriers to the use of NRT use need to be removed and more effective NRTs need urgently to be developed. Smokeless tobacco could also play an important role in harm reduction, but current European Union regulations and concerns over exploitation by tobacco companies currently preclude wider use. \nCONCLUSION: To improve public health there is an urgent need for an appropriate regulatory framework and regulatory authority at the European level, controlling both tobacco and nicotine products to ensure that the least harmful products are the most accessible. \n\u00a9 2011 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[1, 1, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"Tobacco\"], [5, 6, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence,\"], [11, 11, \"C0012634;T047;64572001\", \"disorder,\"], [23, 23, \"C1306577;T033;268923008,397709008\", \"death\"], [54, 54, \"C4551656;T061;289928003\", \"reduction\"], [57, 57, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [76, 76, \"C1306577;T033;268923008,397709008\", \"death\"], [80, 81, \"C3853727;T033;110483000\", \"tobacco use.\"], [86, 86, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [89, 89, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [97, 99, \"C1278444;T061;313396002\", \"nicotine replacement therapy\"], [105, 105, \"C4551656;T061;289928003\", \"reduction\"], [109, 109, \"C0205082;T033;24484000\", \"severely\"], [131, 131, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [137, 137, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [150, 150, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [205, 205, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [214, 214, \"C4551656;T061;289928003\", \"reduction,\"], [225, 225, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [255, 255, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [257, 257, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [276, 276, \"C0001975;T109,T121;333164008,53041004\", \"Alcohol\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"Tobacco,\"], [1, 1, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [4, 4, \"C4551656;T061;289928003\", \"reduction.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["12738006", "268923008", "323283001", "56294008", "24484000", "397709008", "39953003", "289928003", "53041004", "68540007", "110483000", "313396002", "64572001", "258335003", "333164008"], "id": "8543a5ea-6c52-4fec-911a-48c72f946583", "_version_": 1673674417372135429}, {"title": ["Assessing the nicotine content of smokeless tobacco products."], "journal": "J Am Dent Assoc", "journal_id": "7503060", "date": "1994-05-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "8195501", "abstract": ["The nicotine content of 11 popular brands of smokeless tobacco--including moist snuff, plug and loose-leaf chewing tobacco--was analyzed.

A range of physical and chemical product design changes provide precise control over the quantity, form, and perception of nicotine dose, and support compensatory behavior, which is driven by the smoker's addiction to nicotine. Cigarette manufacturers also enhance the physiological effects of nicotine through the introduction and use of compounds that interact with nicotine but do not directly alter its form or delivery. A review of internal documents indicates important historical differences, as well as significant differences between commercial brands, underscoring the effectiveness of methods adopted by manufacturers to control nicotine dosing and target the needs of specific populations of smokers through commercial product development.

Green tobacco sickness (GTS) is known as a disease of acute nicotine intoxication among tobacco farmers. Until now, GTS has been recognized globally as a disease that results from nicotine absorption through the skin. However, we assumed that GTS might also result from nicotine inhalation as well as absorption. We aimed to measure the airborne nicotine concentrations in various work environments of Korean tobacco farmers. \nMETHODS: We measured the nicotine concentrations in the tobacco fields, private curing barns, and joint curing barns of farmers from July to October 2010. All sampling and analyses of airborne nicotine were conducted according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health manual of analytic methods. \nRESULTS: The airborne nicotine concentrations (geometric mean [geometric standard deviation]) in the tobacco field were 83.4 mg/m(3) (1.2) in the upper region and 93.3 mg/m(3) (1.2) in the lower region. In addition, the nicotine concentration by personal sampling was 150.1 mg/m(3). Similarly, the nicotine concentrations in the private curing barn, workers in curing barns, the front yard of the curing barn, and in the joint curing barn were 323.7 mg/m(3) (2.0), 121.0 mg/m(3) (1.5), 73.7 mg/m(3) (1.7), and 610.3 mg/m(3) (1.0), respectively. \nCONCLUSIONS: The nicotine concentration in the workplaces of tobacco farmers was very high.

Agricultural workers manually harvest tobacco and thus have the potential for skin exposure to nicotine, particularly on the hands. Often gloves are not worn as it hinders the harvesters' ability to harvest the tobacco leaves. The purposes of this study were to measure the concentration of nicotine residue on the hands of tobacco harvesters and the effectiveness of hand washing at removing the residue. Wipe samples from the hands of 12 tobacco harvesters were collected at the end of morning and afternoon work periods over two consecutive days. Each harvester had one hand wiped before washing his hands, and the other hand wiped after washing his hands with soap and water. Eight samples per worker were collected over the two days for a total of 96 samples collected. In addition to the hand-wipe samples, leaf-wipe samples were collected from 15 tobacco plants to estimate the amount of nicotine residue on the plants. The average nicotine level in leaf-wipe samples was 1.0 microg cm(-2). The geometric mean pre-wash and post-wash nicotine levels on the hands were 10 and 0.38 microg cm(-2), respectively. Nicotine leaf-wipe level, right or left hand and time of sampling did not significantly influence exposure. Job position-working on the bottom versus the top of the tobacco harvesting machine-was associated with nicotine levels. Pre-wash nicotine levels were higher for workers on the bottom of the harvester but not significantly higher (P = 0.17). Post-wash nicotine levels were significantly higher for workers on the bottom of the harvester (P = 0.012). A substantial amount of nicotine was transferred to the hands, but washing with soap and water in the field significantly reduced nicotine levels by an average of 96% (P < 0.0001)."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[1, 1, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [2, 2, \"C0221423;T184;39104002\", \"sickness\"], [5, 5, \"C0221423;T184;39104002\", \"illness\"], [8, 8, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [11, 11, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [17, 17, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [24, 24, \"C1123023;T022;39937001.C1278993;T022;181469002\", \"skin\"], [25, 25, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [27, 27, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [46, 46, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [59, 59, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [65, 65, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [71, 71, \"C1281583;T023;302539009\", \"hand\"], [84, 84, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [105, 105, \"C1281583;T023;302539009\", \"hand\"], [114, 114, \"C1281583;T023;302539009\", \"hand\"], [123, 123, \"C0043047;T121,T197;346712003,11713004\", \"water.\"], [153, 153, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [160, 160, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [167, 167, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [182, 182, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [194, 194, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [199, 200, \"C0230371;T023;85151006.C1288949;T023;368456002\", \"left hand\"], [204, 204, \"C0441621;T060;257915005\", \"sampling\"], [209, 209, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure.\"], [220, 220, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [225, 225, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [228, 228, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [248, 248, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [268, 268, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [279, 279, \"C0043047;T121,T197;346712003,11713004\", \"water\"], [285, 285, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [1, 1, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [3, 3, \"C0011121;T061;409530006\", \"decontamination\"], [5, 5, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["39953003", "71677004", "323283001", "85151006", "257915005", "346712003", "39937001", "68540007", "302539009", "11713004", "39104002", "409530006", "368456002", "181469002"], "id": "15d67000-4c9b-412e-a35e-c824c788aaa2", "_version_": 1673673937077141513}, {"title": ["Effect of nicotine on the tobacco withdrawal syndrome."], "journal": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)", "journal_id": "7608025", "date": "1984-01-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "6429705", "abstract": ["This study tested the ability of nicotine to alleviate the tobacco withdrawal syndrome.

There is also reason to believe that abstaining from smoking may increase pain during the early stages of smoking cessation. The goal of this study was to test the effects of nicotine deprivation on experimental pain reactivity. Daily tobacco cigarette smokers (N = 165; 43% female) were randomized to either extended nicotine deprivation (12-24 hr smoking abstinence), minimal deprivation (2 hr smoking abstinence), or continued smoking conditions, prior to undergoing pain induction via topical capsaicin. As hypothesized, results indicated that extended deprivation (relative to continued smoking) increased capsaicin-induced pain intensity ratings, neurogenic inflammation, and mechanical hyperalgesia, thus implicating both central and peripheral mechanisms of action in the effects of smoking abstinence on pain reactivity. Pain intensity ratings were also positively correlated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and exploratory analyses suggest that pain sensitivity may increase with duration of smoking abstinence. Collectively, these findings indicate that smokers may experience a variety of negative pain-related sequelae during the early stages of a quit attempt. Future research should examine pain as a consequence or correlate of the nicotine withdrawal syndrome, and determine whether smokers may benefit from tailored cessation interventions that account for nicotine deprivation-induced amplification of pain.

The average nicotine content in each HB head (20 gm) of unflavored tobacco was (713 mg/head) and flavored tobacco has (67 mg/head). One head of unflavored tobacco has nicotine equivalent to 70 regular cigarettes. The addition of adulterations; honey, glycerin and other flavors in the process of preparing the flavored (Muasel) tobacco contributes to lowering the nicotine content in each gram of flavored tobacco. Smoking one head of flavored (Mua'sel) tobacco which contains on average one third of nicotine presented in 20 cigarettes (204 mg/pack) usually resulted in a higher plasma nicotine level by 20%. \nCONCLUSION: Hubble-bubble smokers are not at a lesser risk from smoking than cigarette smokers in relation to nicotine dependence. The inability of water to trap significant amounts of chemical substances present in tobacco (especially nicotine) and the danger which might result from the combustion of additives like; glycerin, honey and other flavors could be a very important factor to extrapolate the damage resulting from HB smoking."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[4, 4, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [9, 9, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [12, 12, \"C0019046;T116,T123;38082009\", \"(HB)\"], [24, 24, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [31, 31, \"C0019046;T116,T123;38082009\", \"HB\"], [32, 32, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [37, 37, \"C0017110;T104;74947009,736680000.C1704673;T122;763824009\", \"gas\"], [62, 62, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [75, 75, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco,\"], [81, 81, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [85, 85, \"C0019046;T116,T123;38082009\", \"HB\"], [86, 86, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [91, 91, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [97, 97, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [102, 102, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [105, 105, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [107, 107, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [117, 117, \"C0939937;T109,T121;421498008\", \"honey,\"], [118, 118, \"C0017861;T109,T123,T121;404833002,80582002\", \"glycerin\"], [130, 130, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [135, 135, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [142, 142, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco.\"], [145, 145, \"C1281590;T023;302548004.C0018670;T029;69536005\", \"head\"], [149, 149, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [157, 157, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [169, 169, \"C0032105;T031;419185008,50863008\", \"plasma\"], [170, 170, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [191, 192, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence.\"], [196, 196, \"C0043047;T121,T197;346712003,11713004\", \"water\"], [202, 202, \"C0220806;T103;441900009\", \"chemical\"], [206, 206, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [208, 208, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine)\"], [221, 221, \"C0017861;T109,T123,T121;404833002,80582002\", \"glycerin,\"], [222, 222, \"C0939937;T109,T121;421498008\", \"honey\"], [235, 235, \"C0010957;T037;37782003\", \"damage\"], [238, 238, \"C0019046;T116,T123;38082009\", \"HB\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [3, 3, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["74947009", "441900009", "39953003", "37782003", "419185008", "736680000", "38082009", "80582002", "323283001", "763824009", "68540007", "69536005", "56294008", "404833002", "50863008", "11713004", "302548004", "421498008", "346712003"], "id": "f7d43d93-3679-48b7-8da0-ddf8fea8163f", "_version_": 1673673915943092246}, {"title": ["In vitro study of nicotine release from smokeless tobacco."], "journal": "J AOAC Int", "journal_id": "9215446", "date": "1998-06-02T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "9606918", "abstract": ["Four brands (Copenhagen Snuff, Skoal Bandit Classic, Skoal Wintergreen Long Cut, and Skoal Wintergreen Fine Cut) of smokeless tobacco products were tested for their rate of nicotine release into artificial saliva via direct contact or through a dialysis bag.

Nicotine is an important tobacco constituent that is responsible for addictive properties of smoking. The currently available medications for the treatment of nicotine addiction have limited efficacy. A challenging novel therapeutic concept is vaccination against nicotine. An efficient vaccine would generate antibodies that sequester nicotine in the blood and prevent its access to the brain.

Therefore, animal models are needed that allow the investigation of chronic exposure to the full spectrum of tobacco smoke constituents. \nOBJECTIVES: The aim of these studies was to investigate if exposure to tobacco smoke leads to nicotine dependence in rats. \nMETHODS: The intracranial self-stimulation procedure was used to assess the negative affective aspects of nicotine withdrawal. Somatic signs were recorded from a checklist of nicotine abstinence signs. Nicotine self-administration sessions were conducted to investigate if tobacco smoke exposure affects the motivation to self-administer nicotine. Nicotinic receptor autoradiography was used to investigate if exposure to tobacco smoke affects central alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and non-alpha7 nAChR levels (primarily alpha4beta2 nAChRs). \nRESULTS: The nAChR antagonist mecamylamine dose-dependently elevated the brain reward thresholds of the rats exposed to tobacco smoke and did not affect the brain reward thresholds of the untreated control rats. Furthermore, mecamylamine induced more somatic withdrawal signs in the smoke-exposed rats than in the control rats. Nicotine self-administration was decreased 1 day after the last tobacco smoke exposure sessions and was returned to control levels 5 days later. Tobacco smoke exposure increased the alpha7 nAChR density in the CA2/3 area and the stratum oriens and increased the non-alpha7 nAChR density in the dentate gyrus. \nCONCLUSION: Tobacco smoke exposure leads to nicotine dependence as indicated by precipitated affective and somatic withdrawal signs and induces an upregulation of nAChRs in the hippocampus."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[1, 2, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"Tobacco smoke\"], [4, 4, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [15, 15, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [29, 29, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [35, 36, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [48, 48, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [50, 51, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [54, 55, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence\"], [60, 60, \"C0524466;T029;303231004\", \"intracranial\"], [68, 68, \"C0205160;T033;260385009\", \"negative\"], [72, 73, \"C0028047;T048;90755006\", \"nicotine withdrawal.\"], [82, 82, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [85, 85, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [93, 94, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [95, 95, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [101, 101, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine.\"], [102, 103, \"C0034830;T116,T192;32180005\", \"Nicotinic receptor\"], [110, 110, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [112, 113, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [118, 119, \"C0034792;T116,T192;20685001\", \"acetylcholine receptor\"], [132, 132, \"C0025029;T109,T121;372828008,73277004\", \"mecamylamine\"], [136, 136, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [142, 145, \"C0425309;T033;43381005\", \"exposed to tobacco smoke\"], [151, 151, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [160, 160, \"C0025029;T109,T121;372828008,73277004\", \"mecamylamine\"], [175, 175, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [184, 185, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [186, 186, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [197, 198, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"Tobacco smoke\"], [199, 199, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [221, 222, \"C1281026;T023;279211002.C0152314;T023;89081005\", \"dentate gyrus.\"], [224, 225, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"Tobacco smoke\"], [226, 226, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [229, 230, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence\"], [248, 248, \"C1284077;T023;361561007.C0019564;T023;5366008\", \"hippocampus.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 1, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"Tobacco smoke\"], [2, 2, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [4, 5, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["56294008", "20685001", "90755006", "12738006", "102407002", "68540007", "5366008", "43381005", "260385009", "279211002", "361561007", "89081005", "323283001", "372828008", "303231004", "71677004", "32180005", "73277004", "258335003"], "id": "1278ebec-76cf-424b-b07a-4f58a6457c47", "_version_": 1673674269246095369}, {"title": ["Urinary levels of nicotine & cotinine in tobacco users."], "journal": "Indian J Med Res", "journal_id": "0374701", "date": "2004-01-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "14700346", "abstract": ["BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Of the various biochemical markers used to validate the smoking status of a person, nicotine and continine are considered as good markers for both active and passive smoking. In the present study an attempt was made to estimate urinary levels of nicotine and cotinine in healthy individuals from north India using different types of tobacco to identify and validate the smoking status. \nMETHODS: Twenty four hour urine sample of 130 healthy volunteers (smokers=70, passive smokers=20, tobacco chewers=20, non smokers=20) were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Smokers were divided into different groups, viz., cigarette, bidi and hooka smokers. \nRESULTS: The mean values of nicotine (ng/ml) and cotinine (ng/ml) in urine were highest in cigarette smokers (nicotine=703.50+/-304.34; cotinine=2736.20+/-983.29), followed by hooka smokers (nicotine 548.0+/-103.47 and cotinine 2379.0+/-424.25), and bidi smokers (nicotine=268.53+/-97.62, cotinine=562.60+/-249.38). There was no correlation of nicotine or cotinine values with smoking index. In passive smokers (nicotine=109.75+/-22.33, cotinine=280.75+/-86.30) and in nonsmokers, the values were much lower (nicotine=55.00+/-13.71, cotinine=7.30+/-2.47) compared to smokers. In tobacco chewers, the values for nicotine and cotinine were 447.75+/-145.09 and 2178.30+/-334.29 respectively. \nINTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: All forms of tobacco users had significantly higher values compared to passive smokers and nonusers.

The results indicated the importance of physiological and psychological effects induced by denic smoking. \nMethods: Regional mu opioid binding potential (non-displaceable binding potential, BPND) was measured in 20 adult male overnight abstinent chronic tobacco smokers. The denic sessions were conducted about 8:00 AM followed by avnic sessions about 2 hours later. Venous plasma nicotine levels and scores of craving to smoke were assessed before and after each smoking session. Fagerstrom scores of nicotine dependence were determined. Pearson's and Spearman's correlation tests were used to examine associations between BPND and other smoking parameters. \nResults: Surprisingly the very low plasma nicotine peak levels after denic smoking (mean\u00b1SD: 3.3\u00b11.8 ng/ml) were significantly correlated with BPND after denic and avnic smoking. Equally surprising no association was found between nicotine levels after avnic smoking and BPND. Delta craving scores and Fagerstrom scores were correlated with both BPND after denic and avnic in several brain regions. \nConclusions: Very small amounts of nicotine, psychological and behavioral effects of denic smoking appear to have important actions on the endogenous mu opioid system. \nImplications: Associations between very low venous plasma nicotine levels after denic smoking and regional brain mu opioid receptor availability are a surprising \"placebo\" effect. Delta craving and Fagerstrom scores were correlated with BPND in several brain regions including amygdala, hippocampus, insula, nucleus accumbens, putamen and ventral striatum.

However, nicotine itself is a weak reinforcer compared to other commonly abused drugs, leading speculation that other factors contribute to the high prevalence of tobacco addiction in the human population. In addition to nicotine, there are over 5000 chemical compounds that have been identified in tobacco smoke, and more work is needed to ascertain their potential contributions to tobacco's highly addictive properties, or as potential candidates for smoking cessation treatment. In this study, we examined seven non-nicotine tobacco constituent compounds (anabasine, anatabine, nornicotine, myosmine, harmane, norharmane, and tyramine) for their effects on nicotine self-administration behavior in rats. Young adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were allowed to self-administer nicotine (0.03 mg/kg/50 \u03bcl infusion) under a fixed ratio-1 schedule of reinforcement. Each self-administration session lasted 45 min. Doses of each tobacco constituent compound were administered subcutaneously 10 min prior to the start of each session in a repeated measures, counterbalanced order two times. Anabasine displayed a biphasic dose-effect function. Pretreatment with 0.02 mg/kg anabasine resulted in a 25% increase in nicotine self-administration, while 2.0mg/kg of anabasine reduced nicotine infusions per session by over 50%. Pretreatment with 2.0mg/kg anatabine also significantly reduced nicotine self-administration by nearly half. These results suggest that some non-nicotine tobacco constituents may enhance or reduce nicotine's reinforcing properties. Also, depending upon the appropriate dose, some of these compounds may also serve as potential smoking cessation agents. \nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Much of this research can be viewed as a tale of \"two\" drugs--nicotine as a key to an important public health problem, and nicotine as a classical tool of physiological and pharmacological research. A historical overview of research on \"both\" drugs is provided first. Public policy alternatives for reducing the prevalence of tobacco use have been derived in part from basic and clinical research results and are briefly outlined. Evidence for genetic determinants on nicotine use and effects is presented using data from twin studies and from molecular genetic research with humans and animals. Consistent with this research, there is evidence of individual differences in pharmacokinetics and effects of nicotine, which could account for differences in smoking behavior and nicotine dependence. Finally, recent developments in the therapeutic uses of nicotine and novel nicotinic agonists with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome and ulcerative colitis are presented.

Jasmonic acid (JA) acts as a long-distance signal between the wounding stimulus and response in tobacco plants. In addition, another phloem-mobile signal (auxin) plays a role in the transmission of the message triggered by wounding. Auxin can serve as a negative signal to regulate nicotine synthesis in roots of tobacco plants, even when plants are not wounded.

Biotechnological approaches have been evaluated in connection with this objective, but field-based results are few. Here, we report characterization of two genes encoding basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs), NtMYC2a and NtMYC2b from tobacco. Overexpression of NtMYC2a increased leaf nicotine levels in T1 transgenic lines approximately 2.3-fold in greenhouse-grown plants of tobacco cultivar 'NC 95'. Subsequent field testing of T2 and T3 generations of transgenic NtMYC2a overexpression lines showed nicotine concentrations were 76% and 58% higher than control lines, respectively. These results demonstrated that the increased nicotine trait was stably inherited to the T2 and T3 generations, indicating the important role that NtMYC2a plays in regulating nicotine accumulation in N. tabacum and the great potential of NtMYC2a overexpression in tobacco plants for industrial nicotine production.

The National Toxicology Program of the National Institutes of Health has classified smokeless tobacco as a human carcinogen. Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) are potent carcinogens in smokeless tobacco products, and the pH of the product influences the content of un-ionized nicotine which is the form of nicotine most rapidly absorbed in the mouth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed 40 top-selling brands of moist snuff to measure nicotine, moisture, pH, un-ionized nicotine, and TSNAs, including 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL). The study findings indicate that moist snuff brands varied widely in content of rapidly absorbed, addictive un-ionized nicotine (500-fold range) and of carcinogenic TSNAs (18-fold range). Product characteristics such as packaging and moisture content appeared to be correlated with concentrations of un-ionized nicotine, and flavor characteristics of low-priced brands may correlate with TSNA concentrations. These findings warrant further study in light of (a) the marketing of smokeless tobacco for use in places where smoking is prohibited, (b) the promotion of smokeless tobacco as a harm-reduction product, and (c) the ever-expanding number of highly flavored smokeless varieties brought to the market."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[9, 9, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco.\"], [17, 17, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [31, 32, \"C3853727;T033;110483000\", \"tobacco use\"], [36, 36, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [37, 37, \"C0085281;T048;32709003\", \"addiction.\"], [51, 51, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [55, 55, \"C0007090;T131;88376000\", \"carcinogen.\"], [64, 64, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [68, 68, \"C1304686;T033;365723003\", \"pH\"], [77, 77, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [83, 83, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [89, 89, \"C0230028;T029;123851003,836005.C1267547;T029;21082005.C1278910;T029;181220002\", \"mouth.\"], [96, 96, \"C0199176;T061;169443000,360271000\", \"Prevention\"], [106, 106, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [108, 108, \"C1304686;T033;365723003\", \"pH,\"], [110, 110, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [133, 133, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [158, 158, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [183, 183, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [197, 197, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C0733511;T058;225419007\", \"Surveillance\"], [5, 5, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [7, 7, \"C1304686;T033;365723003\", \"pH,\"], [9, 9, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["323283001", "110483000", "21082005", "68540007", "169443000", "360271000", "88376000", "836005", "32709003", "181220002", "365723003", "225419007", "123851003", "39953003"], "id": "f888c2b5-e8f1-49c7-b204-96635c6006a5", "_version_": 1673674206335729671}, {"title": ["Blood nicotine, smoke exposure and tobacco withdrawal symptoms."], "journal": "Addict Behav", "journal_id": "7603486", "date": "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "4091074", "abstract": ["The relationship between tobacco withdrawal symptoms and pre- and post-cigarette blood nicotine levels, pre-cigarette cotinine levels, change in nicotine level from pre- to post-cigarette, half-life for nicotine, and total smoke exposure was examined in 20 smokers.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which parental smoking increases the risk for smoking are not known. The aim of these studies was to investigate if preadolescent tobacco smoke exposure, postnatal days 21-35, affects the rewarding effects of nicotine and nicotine withdrawal in adult rats. The rewarding effects of nicotine were investigated with the conditioned place preference procedure. Nicotine withdrawal was investigated with the conditioned place aversion procedure and intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). Elevations in brain reward thresholds in the ICSS paradigm reflect a dysphoric state. Plasma nicotine and cotinine levels in the preadolescent rats immediately after smoke exposure were 188 ng/ml and 716 ng/ml, respectively. Preadolescent tobacco smoke exposure led to the development of nicotine dependence as indicated by an increased number of mecamylamine-precipitated somatic withdrawal signs in the preadolescent tobacco smoke exposed rats compared to the control rats. Nicotine induced a similar place preference in adult rats that had been exposed to tobacco smoke or air during preadolescence. Furthermore, mecamylamine induced place aversion in nicotine dependent rats but there was no effect of preadolescent tobacco smoke exposure. Finally, preadolescent tobacco smoke exposure did not affect the elevations in brain reward thresholds associated with precipitated or spontaneous nicotine withdrawal. These studies indicate that passive exposure to tobacco smoke during preadolescence leads to the development of nicotine dependence but preadolescent tobacco smoke exposure does not seem to affect the rewarding effects of nicotine or nicotine withdrawal in adulthood. \nPublished by Elsevier Inc."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[39, 40, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [41, 41, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure,\"], [50, 50, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [52, 53, \"C0028047;T048;90755006\", \"nicotine withdrawal\"], [61, 61, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [70, 71, \"C0028047;T048;90755006\", \"Nicotine withdrawal\"], [81, 81, \"C0524466;T029;303231004\", \"intracranial\"], [86, 86, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [97, 97, \"C0032105;T031;419185008,50863008\", \"Plasma\"], [98, 98, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [100, 100, \"C0010194;T109,T121;115620009\", \"cotinine\"], [108, 108, \"C0037366;T131;64197008\", \"smoke\"], [109, 109, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [118, 119, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [120, 120, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [126, 127, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence\"], [142, 143, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [151, 151, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [163, 166, \"C0425309;T033;43381005\", \"exposed to tobacco smoke\"], [168, 168, \"C3536832;T121,T197;417696007\", \"air\"], [172, 172, \"C0025029;T109,T121;372828008,73277004\", \"mecamylamine\"], [177, 177, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [187, 188, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [189, 189, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure.\"], [192, 193, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [194, 194, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [201, 201, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [209, 210, \"C0028047;T048;90755006\", \"nicotine withdrawal.\"], [216, 216, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [218, 219, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [227, 228, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence\"], [231, 232, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [233, 233, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [243, 243, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [245, 246, \"C0028047;T048;90755006\", \"nicotine withdrawal\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[1, 2, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [3, 3, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [7, 8, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence\"], [17, 17, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [19, 20, \"C0028047;T048;90755006\", \"nicotine withdrawal\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["90755006", "71677004", "56294008", "68540007", "43381005", "372828008", "115620009", "64197008", "303231004", "258335003", "419185008", "323283001", "73277004", "417696007", "102407002", "12738006", "50863008"], "id": "56ed9bd5-2927-44d2-a563-5126e24cee81", "_version_": 1673674311953547271}, {"title": ["Levels of nicotine in dust from homes of smokeless tobacco users."], "journal": "Nicotine Tob Res", "journal_id": "9815751", "date": "2013-07-26T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "23884321", "abstract": ["BACKGROUND: Smokeless tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco or moist snuff, contain many of the same constituents as tobacco smoke and are also known to cause cancer; however, little attention has been paid to indirect exposure of children to tobacco constituents via parental smokeless tobacco use. \nMETHODS: As part of the California Childhood Leukemia Study, we collected dust samples from 6 residences occupied by smokeless tobacco users, 6 residences occupied by active smokers, and 20 tobacco-free residences. Children's potential for exposure to tobacco constituents was assessed using nicotine concentrations in vacuum dust measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. \nRESULTS: Median nicotine concentrations for residences with smokeless tobacco users were significantly greater than median nicotine concentrations for tobacco-free homes and similar to median nicotine concentrations in homes of active smokers. Using generalized estimating equations derived from a multivariable marginal model to adjust for a history of parental smoking, income, residence construction date, and mother's age and race/ethnicity, we found nicotine levels from homes of smokeless tobacco users to be 21-fold higher than nicotine levels from tobacco-free homes. Based on mass balance equations, we hypothesize that nicotine is transferred to floors in homes of smokeless tobacco users primarily as a constituent of tobacco that is spilled or expectorated. \nCONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we conclude that children living with smokeless tobacco users may be exposed to nicotine and other constituents of tobacco via contact with contaminated dust and household surfaces."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[2, 2, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [7, 7, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [18, 19, \"C0439994;T131;102407002\", \"tobacco smoke\"], [26, 26, \"C0006826;T191;363346000.C1306459;T191;372087000,86049000\", \"cancer;\"], [35, 35, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [39, 39, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [44, 45, \"C3853727;T033;110483000\", \"tobacco use.\"], [53, 53, \"C0023418;T191;93143009,87163000\", \"Leukemia\"], [65, 65, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [80, 80, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [82, 82, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [87, 87, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [94, 94, \"C0017110;T104;74947009,736680000.C1704673;T122;763824009\", \"gas\"], [96, 96, \"C0436196;T059;169278002\", \"spectrometry.\"], [99, 99, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [105, 105, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [112, 112, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [121, 121, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [142, 143, \"C0262926;T033;392521001\", \"history of\"], [148, 148, \"C0441513;T061;129376004,410614008,410615009\", \"construction\"], [157, 157, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [163, 163, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [170, 170, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [177, 177, \"C0577559;T033;4147007,300848003\", \"mass\"], [183, 183, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [192, 192, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [199, 199, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [217, 217, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [223, 223, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [228, 228, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[2, 2, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [9, 9, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["93143009", "392521001", "410614008", "87163000", "363346000", "39953003", "71677004", "102407002", "323283001", "763824009", "300848003", "110483000", "372087000", "169278002", "86049000", "68540007", "74947009", "736680000", "4147007", "129376004", "410615009"], "id": "dfadef0f-0c50-4bf2-8147-ba37ffd13976", "_version_": 1673674651094482946}, {"title": ["Vaccination against nicotine: an emerging therapy for tobacco dependence."], "journal": "Expert Opin Investig Drugs", "journal_id": "9434197", "date": "2007-11-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "17970637", "abstract": ["Tobacco dependence is an addiction characterised by compulsive drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior and intensive craving in the absence of tobacco. Nicotine is the major addictive component of tobacco and acts on the reward system in the brain. Together with strong conditional reinforcements, unaided smoking cessation attempts are notoriously unsuccessful and even the most recently introduced pharmacotherapy, varenicline, only achieves a 23% continuous abstinence rate after 1 year. Vaccination against nicotine represents a promising novel concept for treating nicotine addiction. Antibodies against nicotine inhibit the passage of nicotine to brain and thus inhibit its addiction-reinforcing activities. There are three nicotine vaccines that are in clinical development. The first proof-of-concept study in smoking cessation with the vaccine NicQb (Cytos Biotechnology), a nicotine vaccine based on virus-like particles, demonstrated that continuous abstinence rates can be significantly increased by vaccination; however, as expected from the mode of action, a sufficient antibody level had to be achieved. Antibody level dependence of abstinence was also observed with the nicotine vaccine NicVAX (Nabi Biopharmaceuticals).

The main goal of this meta-analysis was to quantify the effects of nicotine/tobacco administration on human experimental pain threshold and tolerance ratings. A search of PubMed and PsycINFO online databases identified 13 eligible articles, including k = 21 tests of pain tolerance (N = 393) and k = 15 tests of pain threshold (N = 339). Meta-analytic integration for both threshold and tolerance outcomes revealed that nicotine administered through tobacco smoke and other delivery systems (eg, patch, nasal spray) produced acute analgesic effects that may be characterized as small to medium in magnitude (Hedges g = 0.35, 95% confidence interval = 0.21-0.50). Publication bias-corrected estimates remained significant and indicated that these effects may be closer to small. Sex composition was observed to be a significant moderator, such that pain threshold effects were more robust among samples that included more men than women. These results help to clarify a mixed literature and may ultimately help to inform the treatment of both pain and nicotine dependence.

During the scan, participants made timed responses to reward-related cues and received feedback. Parameter estimates from cue- and feedback-related activation in medial prefrontal regions and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) were extracted and underwent within- and between-group analyses. Smokers' nicotine dependence severity was included as a continuous predictor variable for neural activation. \nResults: Among smokers (n = 21), withdrawal decreased cue-related activation in the supplementary motor area and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the difference in activation (satiety > withdrawal) in these regions negatively correlated with nicotine dependence severity (Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence). Among nonsmokers (n = 22), nicotine increased the difference in NAcc activation between rewarded and non-rewarded feedback phases. Tobacco withdrawal and acute nicotine also had widespread effects on activation throughout the brain during the feedback phase. \nConclusions: Acute nicotine in nonsmokers may have increased the salience of feedback information, but produced few effects on reward-related activation overall, perhaps reflecting nicotine's modest, indirect effects on reward processing. Conversely, tobacco withdrawal decreased activation compared to satiety, and this difference between conditions correlated with nicotine dependence severity. This suggests that as smokers become more dependent on nicotine, tobacco withdrawal has a more pronounced effect on reward processing. \nImplications: Relative to the acute effects of nicotine in nonsmokers, withdrawal from daily tobacco use had more significant effects on reward-related brain activation. This study suggests that the effects of tobacco withdrawal on reward-related brain function interact with subjects' level of nicotine dependence severity. These are potentially important sources of variability that could contribute to smoking cessation outcomes."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[26, 26, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [29, 30, \"C0461725;T122;385157007\", \"nasal spray\"], [38, 38, \"C0424092;T033;247755007\", \"withdrawn.\"], [65, 66, \"C0028633;T023;427667007\", \"nucleus accumbens\"], [77, 78, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence\"], [103, 104, \"C0026607;T029;279251004,11931008\", \"motor area\"], [123, 124, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence\"], [129, 130, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"Nicotine Dependence).\"], [136, 136, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [149, 149, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"Tobacco\"], [153, 153, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [162, 162, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [169, 169, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [198, 198, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [212, 213, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence\"], [224, 224, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [225, 225, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [242, 242, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [248, 249, \"C3853727;T033;110483000\", \"tobacco use\"], [256, 256, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [265, 265, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [269, 269, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"brain\"], [276, 277, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[3, 3, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [5, 6, \"C3853727;T033;110483000\", \"Tobacco use\"], [8, 8, \"C1269537;T023;258335003.C0006104;T023;12738006\", \"Brain\"], [13, 14, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"Nicotine Dependence\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["427667007", "11931008", "279251004", "110483000", "385157007", "247755007", "56294008", "258335003", "323283001", "68540007", "39953003", "12738006"], "id": "75f40011-a7a8-4685-a75d-8182c1c5d632", "_version_": 1673675354305200131}, {"title": ["SOME CHEMICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON \"LOW NICOTINE\" TOBACCO."], "journal": "Science", "journal_id": "0404511", "date": "1943-02-19T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "17809639", "abstract": ["Chemical and pharmacological tests have been carried out on a sample of \"low nicotine\" tobacco.

We qualitatively analysed a final collection of 309 documents relevant the effects of menthol on nicotine dependence. \nRESULTS: The tobacco industry knows that menthol overrides the harsh taste of tobacco and alleviates nicotine's irritating effects, synergistically interacts with nicotine, stimulates the trigeminal nerve to elicit a 'liking' response for a tobacco product, and makes low tar, low nicotine tobacco products more acceptable to smokers than non-mentholated low delivery products. \nCONCLUSION: Menthol is not only used in cigarettes as a flavour additive; tobacco companies know that menthol also has sensory effects and interacts with nicotine to produce tobacco products that are easier to smoke, thereby making it easier to expose smokers, especially those who are new and uninitiated, to the addictive power of nicotine."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[5, 5, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [12, 12, \"C0025368;T109,T121;73170009,387414008\", \"menthol\"], [16, 17, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence.\"], [29, 29, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"Tobacco\"], [50, 50, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"Tobacco\"], [75, 75, \"C0025368;T109,T121;73170009,387414008\", \"menthol\"], [77, 78, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence.\"], [81, 81, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [85, 85, \"C0025368;T109,T121;73170009,387414008\", \"menthol\"], [91, 91, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [100, 100, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [103, 104, \"C0040996;T023;27612005\", \"trigeminal nerve\"], [112, 112, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [117, 117, \"C0039315;T109;263894008,52423008\", \"tar,\"], [119, 119, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [120, 120, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [129, 129, \"C0011209;T061;360149000,236973005\", \"delivery\"], [132, 132, \"C0025368;T109,T121;73170009,387414008\", \"Menthol\"], [143, 143, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [147, 147, \"C0025368;T109,T121;73170009,387414008\", \"menthol\"], [155, 155, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [158, 158, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [164, 164, \"C0037366;T131;64197008\", \"smoke,\"], [184, 184, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[4, 5, \"C0028043;T048;56294008\", \"nicotine dependence:\"], [7, 7, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["323283001", "27612005", "236973005", "39953003", "68540007", "263894008", "387414008", "56294008", "73170009", "52423008", "64197008", "360149000"], "id": "d6d0775c-6006-4be0-8299-b8fc5a58cfa0", "_version_": 1673674430183636993}, {"keyword": ["carbon monoxide", "high temperature", "jasmonic acid", "nicotine", "tobacco"], "title": ["Carbon Monoxide Potentiates High Temperature-Induced Nicotine Biosynthesis in Tobacco."], "journal": "Int J Mol Sci", "journal_id": "101092791", "date": "2018-01-11T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "29316708", "abstract": ["Carbon monoxide (CO) acts as an important signal in many physiological responses in plants, but its role in plant secondary metabolism is still unknown.

In this study, we demonstrate that high temperature (HT) induces quick accumulation of nicotine in tobacco roots, combined with an increase in CO and JA concentration. Suppressing CO generation reduced both JA and nicotine biosynthesis, whereas exogenous application of CO increased JA and nicotine content. CO causes an increased expression of NtPMT1 (a key nicotine biosynthesis enzyme), via promoting NtMYC2a binding to the G-box region of its promoter, leading to heightened nicotine levels under HT conditions.

The purpose of this study was to determine the dose-related effects of transdermal nicotine (TN) on tobacco abstinence symptoms in 75 men and 53 women who regularly smoked cigarettes but who had abstained from smoking for at least 8-12 hr. Participants completed 4 double-blind, randomized 6.5-hr laboratory sessions that differed by TN dose (0, 7, 21, or 42 mg). Each session included blood sampling for plasma nicotine level, measurement of heart rate, participants' ratings of tobacco abstinence symptoms and effects of nicotine, and psychomotor performance. Increases in plasma nicotine level were related to TN dose and were independent of gender. TN-induced abstinence symptom suppression was dose-related for items assessing craving and urge to smoke and largely was independent of gender. TN increased heart rate and ratings of aversive side effects (e.g., nausea, lightheadedness) in a dose-related manner, and women were more sensitive at higher doses.

A nicotine reduction strategy proposed by Benowitz and Henningfield aims to reduce the nicotine content of tobacco products to an amount below a threshold that supports neither the development nor maintenance of addiction. Many factors must be considered to determine the viability and efficacy of this approach. For example, the policy should be based on precise information on the dose-dependent effects of nicotine on reinforcement and factors that contribute to individual differences in these effects. However, there have been few studies on these topics in humans. Here, we briefly review nicotine pharmacology and reinforcement then present several studies illustrating the application of intravenous (IV) nicotine delivery to study nicotine reinforcement in humans.

Compounds that attenuate nicotine reward are considered promising therapeutic candidates for tobacco dependence, but many of these agents have other actions that limit their potential utility. Nicotine is also highly noxious, particularly at higher doses, and aversive reactions to nicotine after initial exposure can decrease the likelihood of developing a tobacco habit in many first time smokers. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of nicotine aversion. The purpose of this review is to present recent new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms that regulate avoidance of nicotine. First, the role of the mesocorticolimbic system, so often associated with nicotine reward, in regulating nicotine aversion is highlighted. Second, genetic variation that modifies noxious responses to nicotine and thereby influences vulnerability to tobacco dependence, in particular variation in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit gene cluster, will be discussed. Third, the role of the habenular complex in nicotine aversion, primarily medial habenular projections to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) but also lateral habenular projections to rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) are reviewed. Forth, brain circuits that are enriched in nAChRs, but whose role in nicotine avoidance has not yet been assessed, will be identified. Finally, the feasibility of developing novel therapeutic agents for tobacco dependence that act not by blocking nicotine reward but by enhancing nicotine avoidance will be considered.

Nicotine and related pyridine alkaloids in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) are essential secondary metabolites. Whether environmental factors control nicotine biosynthesis and the underlying mechanism remains previously unreported. Here, we applied physiological and biochemical approaches to investigate how salt stress affects nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco. We found that salt stress induced the biosynthesis of JA, which subsequently triggered the activation of JA-responsive gene expression and, ultimately, nicotine synthesis. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the existence of many NtMYC2a-recognized G-box motifs in the promoter regions of NtLOX, NtAOS, NtAOC and NtOPR genes.

Arguments are presented in this commentary which take issue with this popular dogma, by providing evidence that nicotine metabolites may also be responsible for the CNS effects commonly attributed to nicotine. CNS effects attributed to nicotine include reinforcing effects, mood elevation, arousal, locomotor stimulant effects, and learning and memory enhancement. The reinforcing and locomotor stimulant effects of nicotine have been suggested to be the result of activation of CNS dopaminergic systems, and nicotine-induced modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission has been studied in detail. Nicotine acts at a family of nicotinic receptor subtypes composed of multiple subunits; however, the exact composition of the subunits in native nicotinic receptors and the functional significance of the receptor subtype diversity are currently unknown. This nicotinic subtype diversity increases the complexity of the potential mechanisms of action of nicotine and its metabolites. Although peripheral metabolism of nicotine has been studied extensively, metabolism in the CNS has not been investigated to any great extent. Recently, studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that several nicotine metabolites are present in the CNS after acute nicotine administration. Moreover, nicotine metabolites are pharmacologically active in neurochemical and behavioral assays.

Several venous blood samples were withdrawn before and during the smoking sessions for subsequent analyses. The increases in plasma nicotine correlated well with plasma cortisol and prolactin levels (correlation coefficients r=0.66 and 0.53, respectively, p<0.05). This study quantifies the well known increase in plasma cortisol and prolactin after nicotine postsmoking for about 1h with peak plasma levels up to 35 ng/ml. Contrary to most abused drugs which release dopamine and decrease prolactin, nicotine concentration correlated with increased prolactin release.

Finally, some newer approaches to cessation are noted. \nCopyright \u00a9 2017 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [7, 7, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco,\"], [11, 11, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [22, 22, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [30, 30, \"C1299586;T033;371157007\", \"difficulty\"], [38, 38, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [48, 49, \"C0439857;T048;103326000,255338002\", \"dependence on\"], [62, 62, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine;\"], [65, 65, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [2, 2, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"Tobacco\"], [6, 6, \"C0562381;T033;386702006\", \"Abuse\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["255338002", "39953003", "68540007", "103326000", "371157007", "323283001", "386702006"], "id": "b70cc020-7d7f-4f31-ae99-00dcad0b5d22", "_version_": 1673675146896867339}, {"title": ["Effect of high-dose nicotine patch therapy on tobacco withdrawal symptoms among smokeless tobacco users."], "journal": "Nicotine Tob Res", "journal_id": "9815751", "date": "2007-03-17T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "17365735", "abstract": ["No pharmacotherapies have been shown to increase long-term (> or = 6-month) abstinence rates among smokeless tobacco (ST) users. Available evidence suggests that underdosing may occur with standard-dose nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in ST users. We investigated the effect of high-dose nicotine therapy on tobacco withdrawal symptoms among ST users in a randomized, controlled clinical pilot study. A total of 42 ST users using at least 3 cans or pouches per week were randomized to nicotine patch doses of 63, 42, or 21 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks. Multiple daily assessments of tobacco withdrawal and nicotine toxicity were obtained with an electronic diary. During the first week of nicotine patch therapy, we observed a dose-response relationship such that higher nicotine patch doses were associated with less decreased arousal (chi2 = 6.87, p = .009), less negative affect (chi2 = 3.85, p = .05), and less restlessness (chi2 = 3.90, p = .048). During the second week, higher nicotine patch doses were associated with less decreased arousal (chi2 = 6.77, p = .009). Overall, the frequency of nicotine toxicity symptoms did not differ by dose group. Of specific symptoms, nausea was observed to be more frequent in the 63 mg/day dose group compared with placebo (p = .035).

Cessation attempts among women may be hampered by their unique biologic response to nicotine. Current research has revealed epigenetic changes from intrauterine nicotine exposure that have intergenerational consequences. Multiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy of various pharmacologic tobacco cessation interventions in conjunction with behavioral counseling. Based on this evidence, the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2015 guideline recommends pharmacologic therapy for all nonpregnant persons who smoke in addition to behavioral counseling. The effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments among pregnant women is less clear, with far fewer studies evaluating potential benefits and harms. While exposure to pharmacologic therapies raises concerns for fetal safety, these potential risks must be weighed against those of continued tobacco use, which guarantees fetal exposure to nicotine. First-line tobacco cessation medications include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Second-line medications include nortriptyline and clonidine. Pharmacokinetics, effectiveness, regimens, and safety profiles for nonpregnant, pregnant, and lactating women are reviewed.

Serum nicotine concentrations or urine cotinine concentrations can be used to guide nicotine patch dose to achieve biological concentrations adequate to provide the patient with immediate relief from nicotine withdrawal symptoms, an important factor in nicotine withdrawal success. Absence of nicotine metabolites and anabasine can be used to document abstinence from tobacco products, an indicator of treatment success. \nMETHODS: The procedure was designed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, anabasine, and nornicotine in human serum or urine. The technique required simple extraction of the sample with quantification by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. \nRESULTS: The procedure for simultaneous analysis of nicotine, its metabolites, and tobacco alkaloids simultaneously quantified five different analytes. Test limit of quantification, linearity, imprecision, and accuracy were adequate for clinical evaluation of patients undergoing treatment for tobacco dependency. The test readily distinguished individuals who had no exposure to tobacco products from individuals who were either passively exposed or were abstinent past-tobacco users from those who were actively using a tobacco or nicotine product. \nCONCLUSIONS: Nicotine, cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, nornicotine, and anabasine can be simultaneously and accurately quantified in either serum or urine by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry with imprecision <10% at physiologic concentrations and limits of quantification ranging from 0.5 to 5 micro g/L. Knowledge of serum or urine concentrations of these analytes can be used to guide nicotine replacement therapy or to assess tobacco abstinence in nicotine dependency treatment.

Pilot data suggest that 4-mg nicotine lozenge decreases tobacco craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms among ST users. \nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of 12 weeks of 4-mg nicotine lozenge for ST use. \nRESULTS: We randomized 270 participants (136 active lozenge, 134 placebo). No significant differences were observed between the groups in biochemically confirmed all tobacco abstinence rates at Week 12 (36% lozenge vs. 27.6% placebo; odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% CI 0.7-2.1; p = .138). However, the 4-mg nicotine lozenge increased self-reported all tobacco abstinence (44.1% vs. 29.1%; OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.2; p = .011) and self-reported ST abstinence (50.7% vs. 34.3%; OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.2; p = .013) compared with placebo at the end of treatment (Week 12). Following target quit date (TQD), nicotine withdrawal symptoms decreased significantly with time (time effect = -.022 per day, SE = .003; p < .001) and was significantly lower for the active lozenge (treatment effect = -.213, SE = .071; p = .003). Tobacco craving also decreased significantly following TQD (time effect = -.071, SE = .006; p < .001) and was lower for the active nicotine lozenge (treatment effect = -.452, SE = .164; p = .006). \nDISCUSSION: The 4-mg nicotine lozenge increased self-reported but not biochemically confirmed tobacco abstinence rates at 3 months.

This trial is now history, but its legacy will carry on into the 21st century because of the revelations contained in the millions of pages of previously secret internal tobacco industry documents made public in the trial. In this article, we review representative documents relating to nicotine addiction, low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes, and cigarette design and nicotine manipulation in cigarette manufacture. These documents reveal that for decades, the industry knew and internally acknowledged that nicotine is an addictive drug and cigarettes are the ultimate nicotine delivery device; that nicotine addiction can be perpetuated and even enhanced through cigarette design alterations and manipulations; and that \"health-conscious\" smokers could be captured by low-tar, low-nicotine products, all the while ensuring the marketplace viability of their products.

A novel nicotine-degrading strain was isolated and identified as Pseudomonas stutzeri ZCJ based on its 16S rDNA sequence and morphological-biochemical characteristics. In submerged cultures, P. stutzeri ZCJ could tolerate 4.5 g/L nicotine and completely degrade 1.5 g/L nicotine within 24 h at 37\u00b0C and pH 7.4. The addition of glucose (1 g/L) could improve nicotine degradation by P. stutzeri ZCJ in submerged cultures. After submerged culturing, the cell suspension of P. stutzeri ZCJ could be utilized to improve nicotine reduction in tobacco leaves during solid-state fermentation. The nicotine content of tobacco leaves decreased by as much as 32.24% after 7 days of solid-state fermentation by P. stutzeri ZCJ, suggesting the industrial application potential of the native strain to enhance nicotine degradation during the aging of tobacco leaves."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [7, 7, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [33, 33, \"C0080194;T037;48532005\", \"strains\"], [39, 39, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [40, 40, \"C4551656;T061;289928003\", \"reduction\"], [47, 47, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [52, 52, \"C0080194;T037;48532005\", \"strain\"], [80, 80, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [86, 86, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [93, 93, \"C1304686;T033;365723003\", \"pH\"], [98, 98, \"C0017725;T109,T123,T121;111138002,67079006\", \"glucose\"], [103, 103, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [116, 116, \"C1269647;T025;362837007.C0007634;T025;4421005\", \"cell\"], [117, 117, \"C0038960;T122;739008005,7946007\", \"suspension\"], [127, 127, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [128, 128, \"C4551656;T061;289928003\", \"reduction\"], [130, 130, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [136, 136, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [139, 139, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [165, 165, \"C0080194;T037;48532005\", \"strain\"], [168, 168, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [174, 174, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"Nicotine\"], [2, 2, \"C1627358;T061;418393006\", \"enhancement\"], [11, 11, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["48532005", "67079006", "4421005", "365723003", "68540007", "418393006", "111138002", "39953003", "362837007", "739008005", "289928003", "7946007", "323283001"], "id": "d4d2fc50-6b38-44ab-85bf-1060a15701de", "_version_": 1673674545754537995}, {"title": ["Absorption of nicotine from a cigarette that does not burn tobacco."], "journal": "Pharmacology", "journal_id": "0152016", "date": "1988-01-01T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "3237761", "abstract": ["Ten smokers participated in a study to compare the absorption of nicotine from the smoke aerosol of a new cigarette that heats, but does not burn tobacco (test) with a cigarette that burns tobacco (reference).

They were also asked to complete the Fagerstrom Tobacco Questionnaire (FTQ) and the short-form Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised. A total of 136 subjects completed both the interview and the questionnaire. Neuroticism scores were significantly higher in those who had lifetime diagnosis of tobacco/nicotine dependence according to ICD-10, DSM-IV, or FTQ criteria than nondependent ever-smokers (p < 0.05). Lie scores were significantly lower in DSM-III-R or DSM-IV tobacco/nicotine dependence than in nondependent ever-smokers (p < 0.05).

After smoking the second average nicotine yield cigarette, the effects were less than smoking the first. Low-nicotine cigarettes produced fewer changes in rCBF than those after the first average cigarette.

Here we report that water flooding treatment (hypoxia) markedly induced the accumulation of GABA and stimulated nicotine biosynthesis. Suppressing GABA accumulation by treatment with glutamate decarboxylase inhibitor impaired flooding-induced nicotine biosynthesis, while exogenous GABA application directly induced nicotine biosynthesis.

The cardiovascular effects of smoking are probably multifactorial, including effects on platelets. Previous reports investigating the effects of nicotine and tobacco on platelet function are inconsistent. The present study investigated in vitro effects of nicotine, its major metabolites, tobacco extracts and extract of tobacco-free snuff on human platelets. None of the metabolites cotinine, cotinine-N-oxide, nicotine-1'-N-oxide or trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (0.1-10 \u03bcM) affected platelet aggregation or P-selectin expression. Nicotine (10 \u03bcM) weakly increased platelet aggregation, whereas trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (0.1 \u03bcM) and nicotine-1'-N-oxide (1-10 \u03bcM) weakly inhibited adhesion to fibrinogen. To elucidate the influence of other tobacco compounds, we investigated the impact of moist tobacco and smoke extracts on platelet function. Filtered extracts of oral snuff, cigarette smoke and tobacco free snuff inhibited platelet adhesion concentration-dependently. The inhibitory effects of tobacco extracts on platelet adhesion were independent of nicotine content and the nitric-oxide-pathway and not mediated through a platelet-nicotine-receptor. Taken together, tobacco extracts inhibit platelet activation during short-term in vitro challenge. As only limited effects of nicotine and nicotine metabolites were seen, the tobacco-induced platelet inhibition are likely induced by other compounds present in tobacco and tobacco free snuff. \nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it was unclear how this nicotine transporter affected the biosynthesis of the alkaloid nicotine. When NUP1 expression was suppressed in cultured tobacco cells treated with jasmonate, which induces nicotine biosynthesis, the NICOTINE2-locus transcription factor gene ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR189 (ERF189) and its target structural genes, which function in nicotine biosynthesis and transport, were strongly suppressed, resulting in decreased total alkaloid levels. Conversely, NUP1 overexpression had the opposite effect. In these experiments, the expression levels of the MYC2 transcription factor gene and its jasmonate-inducible target gene were not altered. Inhibiting tobacco alkaloid biosynthesis by suppressing the expression of genes encoding enzymes in the nicotine pathway did not affect the expression of ERF189 and other nicotine pathway genes, indicating that ERF189 is not regulated by cellular alkaloid levels. Suppressing the expression of jasmonate signaling components in cultured tobacco cells showed that NUP1 acts downstream of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 receptor and MYC2, but upstream of ERF189. These results suggest that although jasmonate-activated expression of MYC2 induces the expression of both NUP1 and ERF189, expression of ERF189 may actually be mediated by NUP1. Furthermore, NUP1 overexpression in tobacco plants inhibited the long-range transport of nicotine from the roots to the aerial parts. Thus, NUP1 not only mediates the uptake of tobacco alkaloids into root cells, but also positively controls the expression of ERF189, a key gene in the biosynthesis of these alkaloids.  \n\u00a9 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

This spread becomes a public health concern if it is associated with tobacco-caused disease and if WTS supports tobacco/nicotine dependence. A growing literature demonstrates that WTS is associated with disability, disease and death. This narrative review examines if WTS supports nicotine/tobacco dependence, and is intended to help guide tobacco control efforts worldwide. \nDATA SOURCES: PUBMED search using: ((\"waterpipe\" or \"narghile\" or \"arghile\" or \"shisha\" or \"goza\" or \"narkeela\" or \"hookah\" or \"hubble bubble\")) AND (\"dependence\" or \"addiction\"). \nSTUDY SELECTION: Excluded were articles not in English, without original data, and that were not topic-related. Thirty-two articles were included with others identified by inspecting reference lists and other sources. \nDATA SYNTHESIS: WTS and the delivery of the dependence-producing drug nicotine were examined, and then the extent to which the articles addressed WTS-induced nicotine/dependence explicitly, as well as implicitly with reference to criteria for dependence outlined by the WHO. \nCONCLUSIONS: WTS supports nicotine/tobacco dependence because it is associated with nicotine delivery, and because some smokers experience withdrawal when they abstain from waterpipe, alter their behaviour in order to access a waterpipe and have difficulty quitting, even when motivated to do so. There is a strong need to support research investigating measurement of WTS-induced tobacco dependence, to inform the public of the risks of WTS, which include dependence, disability, disease and death, and to include WTS in the same public health policies that address tobacco cigarettes. \nPublished by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Toxicities were determined by colony formation assays using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Results indicated that nicotine is less toxic than smokeless tobacco extract that contained the same amount of nicotine. The generation of reactive oxygen species, following treatment with smokeless tobacco extract and nicotine, was assessed by measurement of changes in glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. CHO cells (5 x 10(5) cells/5 ml media) were incubated with 4, 0.8, and 0.08 mg of nicotine and STE containing the same amounts of nicotine. All preparations of smokeless tobacco extract significantly decreased GSH levels and increased MDA generation. However, 0.08 mg of nicotine treatment did not result in a significant change in GSH level, and only 4 mg of nicotine were sufficient to increase MDA generation. Addition of free radical scavenging enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and an intracellular GSH precursor, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), replenished the GSH levels in nicotine-treated cells. GSH levels in cells exposed to smokeless tobacco extract containing 4 and 0.8 mg nicotine remained significantly lower than the control with the addition of SOD and CAT. However, co-addition of NAC with smokeless tobacco extract preparations returned the GSH levels to the control level. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were measured in the media to establish the membrane damage following exposure to smokeless tobacco extract and nicotine. Treatment of cells with 4 mg nicotine caused a significant increase in LDH activity, which was returned to control level in the presence of the antioxidant enzymes and NAC. Smokeless tobacco extract did not change the LDH activity. http://link.springer-ny. com/link/service/journals/00244/bibs/37n4p434.html</++ +HEA"], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[10, 10, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [11, 11, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [17, 17, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [30, 30, \"C1278992;T023;181464007.C0029939;T023;15497006\", \"ovary\"], [36, 36, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [42, 42, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [43, 43, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [50, 50, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine.\"], [55, 55, \"C0030054;T196,T121,T123;24099007,767111007\", \"oxygen\"], [61, 61, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [62, 62, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [64, 64, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [72, 72, \"C0017817;T121,T116,T123;55477000,423272009\", \"glutathione\"], [75, 75, \"C0024643;T109,T123;706962006\", \"malondialdehyde\"], [76, 76, \"C0000379;T131,T109;44555003\", \"(MDA)\"], [85, 85, \"C0162867;T024;61695000\", \"media)\"], [95, 95, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [103, 103, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine.\"], [108, 108, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [109, 109, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [116, 116, \"C0000379;T131,T109;44555003\", \"MDA\"], [122, 122, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [139, 139, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [144, 144, \"C0000379;T131,T109;44555003\", \"MDA\"], [148, 149, \"C0016693;T104,T123;39265005\", \"free radical\"], [152, 153, \"C0038838;T126,T121,T116;27562008\", \"superoxide dismutase\"], [156, 156, \"C0007367;T126,T116;85491003\", \"catalase\"], [163, 163, \"C0001047;T121,T116;77731008,387440002\", \"N-acetyl-L-cysteine\"], [179, 179, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [180, 180, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [186, 186, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [206, 206, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [207, 207, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [217, 218, \"C0022917;T126,T116;259319003,70012008\", \"Lactate dehydrogenase\"], [225, 225, \"C0162867;T024;61695000\", \"media\"], [230, 230, \"C0010957;T037;37782003\", \"damage\"], [232, 232, \"C0274281;T037;71677004\", \"exposure\"], [235, 235, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [236, 236, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [238, 238, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine.\"], [245, 245, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [269, 269, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [270, 270, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[6, 6, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [11, 11, \"C0038435;T033;262188008,73595000\", \"stress.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["73595000", "706962006", "61695000", "323283001", "259319003", "24099007", "15497006", "387440002", "71677004", "85491003", "68540007", "767111007", "262188008", "44555003", "181464007", "27562008", "77731008", "422077001", "70012008", "39265005", "55477000", "423272009", "37782003", "39953003"], "id": "f2e3f5eb-0177-4962-bd9a-25903b2ff6ff", "_version_": 1673673638659751954}, {"title": ["Tobacco extract but not nicotine impairs the mechanical strength of fracture healing in rats."], "journal": "J Orthop Res", "journal_id": "8404726", "date": "2006-05-18T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "16705735", "abstract": ["The influence of nicotine and tobacco extract (without nicotine) alone and in combination on and mechanical strength of closed femoral fractures in rats was investigated. One hundred four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups receiving: nicotine, tobacco extract, tobacco extract plus nicotine, and saline. One week prior to fracture, osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously in all animals to administer nicotine equivalent to the serum level of nicotine observed in a smoker consuming one to two packs of cigarettes daily. An equivalent volume of saline was administered to the control animals. Tobacco extract was administered orally. A closed transverse femoral diaphysial fracture was performed, and stabilized with an intramedullary pin. The fractures were mechanically tested after 21 days of healing. Tobacco extract alone decreased the mechanical strength. Ultimate torque and torque at yield point of the tobacco extract group were decreased by 21% (p=0.010) and 23% (p=0.056), respectively, compared with the vehicle (saline) group, and by 20% (p=0.023) and 26% (p=0.004), respectively, compared with the nicotine group. No difference was found between the tobacco extract and tobacco extract plus nicotine groups. An 18% (p=0.013) reduction in torque at yield point was observed in the tobacco extract plus nicotine group compared with the nicotine group. No differences in ultimate stiffness, energy absorption, and callus bone mineral content at the fracture line were found between any of the groups. Serum levels of nicotine were between 40-50 ng/mL in the group given nicotine alone and the group given tobacco extract plus nicotine (equivalent to serum levels observed in persons smoking one to two packs of cigarettes per day). \nCopyright (c) 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[3, 3, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [5, 5, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [6, 6, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [8, 8, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine)\"], [19, 19, \"C0015811;T023;261080001,421235005,71341001\", \"femoral\"], [37, 37, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [38, 38, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [39, 39, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract,\"], [40, 40, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [41, 41, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [43, 43, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine,\"], [50, 50, \"C0016658;T037;125605004,72704001\", \"fracture,\"], [61, 61, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [65, 65, \"C0229671;T031;67922002\", \"serum\"], [68, 68, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [72, 72, \"C0337664;T033;77176002\", \"smoker\"], [92, 92, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"Tobacco\"], [93, 93, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [100, 100, \"C0015811;T023;261080001,421235005,71341001\", \"femoral\"], [102, 102, \"C0016658;T037;125605004,72704001\", \"fracture\"], [106, 106, \"C0184512;T033;409051000\", \"stabilized\"], [121, 121, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"Tobacco\"], [122, 122, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [137, 137, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [138, 138, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [152, 152, \"C0042444;T122;412307009,96005000\", \"vehicle\"], [166, 166, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [174, 174, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [175, 175, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [177, 177, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [178, 178, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [180, 180, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [185, 185, \"C4551656;T061;289928003\", \"reduction\"], [195, 195, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [196, 196, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [198, 198, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [203, 203, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [209, 209, \"C0427008;T184;271587009\", \"stiffness,\"], [213, 213, \"C0376154;T020;201040000\", \"callus\"], [214, 214, \"C1266909;T022;128530007.C1266908;T023;90780006\", \"bone\"], [215, 215, \"C0026162;T197;87918000\", \"mineral\"], [219, 219, \"C0016658;T037;125605004,72704001\", \"fracture\"], [228, 228, \"C0229671;T031;67922002\", \"Serum\"], [231, 231, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [240, 240, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [246, 246, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [247, 247, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [249, 249, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [252, 252, \"C0229671;T031;67922002\", \"serum\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[0, 0, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"Tobacco\"], [1, 1, \"C2752151;T122;422077001\", \"extract\"], [4, 4, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [10, 10, \"C0016658;T037;125605004,72704001\", \"fracture\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["271587009", "421235005", "67922002", "125605004", "422077001", "412307009", "323283001", "72704001", "68540007", "39953003", "96005000", "71341001", "409051000", "201040000", "128530007", "261080001", "289928003", "90780006", "87918000", "77176002"], "id": "801cf864-27a8-4ef7-8903-59518079cd34", "_version_": 1673674017084538890}, {"keyword": ["nicotine", "tobacco industry", "tobacco industry documents"], "title": ["Tobacco company strategies to identify and promote the benefits of nicotine."], "journal": "Tob Control", "journal_id": "9209612", "date": "2018-08-11T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "30093414", "abstract": ["BACKGROUND: In response to a changing regulatory and consumer landscape, tobacco companies developed new strategies to promote cigarettes and smoking. We examined one of these strategies: to fund and conduct scientific research related to potential benefits of nicotine, and to use their findings to promote nicotine. \nMETHODS: Qualitative analysis of previously secret tobacco industry documents from the Truth (formerly Legacy) Tobacco Documents Library (industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco), triangulated with data from other sources, including the online search engine Google, from the 1970s to December 2017. \nRESULTS: After publication of the 1988 Surgeon General's report on nicotine addiction, tobacco companies (particularly RJ Reynolds) intensified efforts to promote the benefits of nicotine while downplaying its addictiveness and health risks. Activities included building relationships with academic institutions and funding scientific studies of the benefits of nicotine on cognition and other performance areas through intramural and extramural programmes. Companies then promoted their research findings through public relations campaigns, often minimising nicotine's health risks by comparing it to caffeine or coffee. These comparisons appeared in highly publicised scientific meetings and interviews with the press. Nicotine-positive messages reappeared in the popular press and on some company websites in the 2010s. \nCONCLUSIONS: Tobacco companies implemented strategies to promote benefits of nicotine to scientific and general audiences while minimising its health risks. These strategies reappeared at the time novel tobacco products like electronic cigarettes were introduced. A greater awareness of the source of claims related to purported benefits of nicotine could inform discussions about emerging tobacco products. \n\u00a9 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

To allow flexibility in pre- and post-fracture exposure periods, the objective of this study was to compare a new oral administration route for nicotine to the established pump method. Four groups were studied: (1) pump saline, (2) pump saline + oral tobacco, (3) pump saline/nicotine + oral tobacco, and (4) pump saline + oral nicotine/tobacco. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 84) received a transverse femoral fracture stabilized with an intramedullary pin 1 week after initiating dosing. After 3 weeks, no difference was found in torsional strength or stiffness between oral nicotine/tobacco or pump nicotine + tobacco, while energy absorption with oral nicotine/tobacco was greater than pump nicotine + tobacco (p < 0.05). Compared to saline control, strength for oral nicotine/tobacco was higher than control (p < 0.05), and stiffnesses for pump nicotine + tobacco and oral nicotine/tobacco were higher than control (p < 0.05). No differences in energy were found for either nicotine-tobacco group compared to saline control. Mean serum cotinine (stable nicotine metabolite) was different between pump and oral nicotine at 1 and 4 weeks, but all groups were in the range of 1-2 pack/day smokers. In summary, relevant serum cotinine levels can be reached in rats with oral nicotine, and, in the presence of tobacco, nicotine can influence mechanical aspects of fracture healing, dependent on administration method. Caution should be exercised when comparing results of fracture healing studies using different methods of nicotine administration. \n(c) 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The 2004 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (US Senate bill S2461) would have given the US Food and Drug Administration limited authority to regulate cigarettes to \"protect the public health.\" However, such legislation is unlikely to substantially reduce smoking or related deaths. \nDISCUSSION: The past 500 years of tobacco control efforts demonstrate that nicotine prohibition is a practical impossibility for numerous reasons, state revenue being one of the most ominous. The FDA already has regulatory authority over pharmaceutical grade nicotine products, and requires pharmacists to dispense the most addictive of these only with prescriptions. Meanwhile, every corner store can sell far more addictive and dangerous cigarettes to any adult. The FDA could immediately increase competition between cigarettes and clean nicotine products by approving available nicotine products for over-the-counter sales to adults. Similarly permissive regulation of cigarettes and addictive nicotine products will reduce tobacco use and improve smokers' health, but increase nicotine use in the population. Fortunately, restricted youth access and accurate labeling of nicotine's absolute risks will dissuade many non-smokers from experimenting with it, while accurate depiction of its risks relative to cigarette smoking will encourage many smokers to switch. The FDA could take a series of small steps that might ultimately replace a large proportion of cigarette smoking with equally addictive nicotine products, without risking serious public health setbacks. Vaccine, methadone, and injury prevention policies establish relevant public health precedents. \nSUMMARY: Cigarettes, or an equally addictive alternative, will be a permanent and common product in most societies. Regulations restricting only the safest addictive nicotine products are hard to justify. Addictive nicotine compliments other tobacco control strategies. Modern tobacco control policies are applicable to addictive nicotine. Controlled trials and test market studies are urgently needed to evaluate addictive nicotine as an alternative to smoking. Meanwhile, legislators should preserve the Food and Drug Administration's option to permit non-prescription sales of addictive nicotine."], "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[25, 25, \"C0199176;T061;169443000,360271000\", \"Prevention\"], [27, 27, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"Tobacco\"], [41, 42, \"C0150270;T058;182832007.C3469597;T061;18629005\", \"Drug Administration\"], [71, 71, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [76, 76, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [102, 102, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [142, 142, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [147, 147, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [161, 161, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [165, 166, \"C3853727;T033;110483000\", \"tobacco use\"], [173, 173, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [235, 235, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [243, 243, \"C0042210;T121,T116,T129;398827000,71181003\", \"Vaccine,\"], [244, 244, \"C0025605;T109,T121;387286002,51758009\", \"methadone,\"], [246, 247, \"C0150638;T061;275826003\", \"injury prevention\"], [277, 277, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [284, 284, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [287, 287, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [291, 291, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"], [298, 298, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine.\"], [311, 311, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [333, 333, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[1, 1, \"C0028040;T131,T109;323283001,68540007\", \"nicotine\"], [5, 5, \"C0009498;T116,T129;20823009\", \"complement\"], [8, 8, \"C0040329;T131,T109;39953003\", \"tobacco\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["182832007", "387286002", "360271000", "39953003", "398827000", "68540007", "51758009", "323283001", "275826003", "169443000", "20823009", "110483000", "18629005", "71181003"], "id": "361c7981-a2f1-4574-b7bc-ffe58159de5b", "_version_": 1673673937056169994}, {"title": ["Research on nicotine and tobacco: a decade of progress."], "journal": "Nicotine Tob Res", "journal_id": "9815751", "date": "2004-09-17T00:00:00Z", "pmid": "15370167", "abstract": ["The 10th annual meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) was held February 19-21, 2004, in Scottsdale, Arizona.
